But what about internationally: what countries celebrate Thanksgiving? How many countries are there that celebrate Thanksgiving? Do they celebrate it in Europe? Short answer: some places. What about in Japan? Short answer: yes, in its own way. And what about Canada? Yes, they do. Here we break down what countries celebrate a form of Thanksgiving around the world and what it looks like in each place based on their history and traditions.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">In the U.S., the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/life/inspirational-stories/a33554048/when-was-the-first-thanksgiving/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="very first Thanksgiving" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">very first Thanksgiving</a> dates back to 1621. But in others their traditions started one various dates in history before and after. Not all of them feast on turkey and dressing, but they all center around giving thanks and celebrating according to their own meaningful traditions (and they might just <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/life/a24218556/thanksgiving-instagram-captions/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="post on Instagram about it like we do" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">post on Instagram about it like we do</a>).

Back in 1578, Canadians gave thanks to celebrate celebrate <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/thanksgiving-day data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sir Martin Frobisher" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Sir Martin Frobisher</a> and his crew's safe arrival in the Eastern Arctic with a fast of salt beef, biscuits, and mushy peas.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Today, though, Canadians' menus look more like Americans do a month later. They have their exceptions though. In Newfoundland they prepare a Jigg's dinner of boiled meat served with a side of split pea pudding, and over in Ontario, dessert looks more like flaky butter tarts, a pastry filled with raisins, walnuts, or pecans.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">Brazil</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Thanksgiving in Brazil, called Dia de Ação de Graças, is a case of monkey see, monkey do. In this instance, the Brazilian ambassador to the U.S. saw Americans enjoying a day of eating delicious food and decided Brazil should do the same. He told then-President Gaspar Dutra of the festivities he observed after a trip in the 1940s, and since then it's become an unofficial holiday in the country.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Thanksgiving in Brazil is essentially the same, even down to the date of the fourth Thursday in November. Instead of having a march of our favorite inflated cartoon characters, Brazilians parade down the street and cap it off with a carnival. A church service giving thanks to the almighty precedes the Carnival-like celebration.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">Germany, Austria, and Switzerland</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Fall back a few months, and you'll land on Erntedankfest—a similar concept to American Thanksgiving celebrated by rural communities in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.german-way.com/history-and-culture/holidays-and-celebrations/thanksgiving-in-germany/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='"rural festival of thanks"' class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">"rural festival of thanks"</a> is usually held in late September or on the first Sunday of October. Residents thank God for the gifts of harvest by holding church services, throwing parades, and playing music.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Aside from both holidays centering around gratefulness, the similarities between American Thanksgiving and Erntedankfest stop there. While Turthahn (turkey) is popular throughout German-speaking countries, during Erntedankfest they might opt to eat Masthühnchen or De Kapaun, (chicken and rooster respectively).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">There also isn't the same emphasis during this festival to travel long distances and gather with family. It's contained in the rural areas of these countries and most people throughout Germany may never experience Ertedankfest unless they seek it out.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">The Netherlands</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Did you know the Pilgrims made a pitstop on their way to Plymouth Rock? According to the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/they-celebrate-american-thanksgiving-in-the-netherlands-140671441/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Smithsonian class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Smithsonian</a>, a community of Pilgrims spent a period of time in the city of Leiden in the Netherlands. Despite just being a blip on their journey to the new world, many residents in Leiden still celebrate an American Thanksgiving every year. However, the focus here is less on the food. Instead of a meal, residents convene in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.wmf.org/project/pieterskerk data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Pieterskerk class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Pieterskerk</a>, a 900-year-old church, to "celebrate the perseverance and good fortunes of the early American settlers."</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">Grenada</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">While some Thanksgivings stretch back to the times of lace collars and oil lamps, others are as young as a millennial. Grenada, an island country in the eastern Caribbean Sea, only first started celebrating Thanksgiving <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/news/8-thanksgiving-celebrations-around-the-world data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="in 1983" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">in 1983</a>. When the U.S. military restored order in the country after their communist leader Maurice Bishop died in 1983, locals surprised the soldiers with a full-course American-style Thanksgiving. The gesture grew into a holiday the people of Grenada continue to celebrate.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">China</h2><img alt="a mooncake is a chinese bakery product traditionally eaten during the mid autumn festival the festival is for lunar worship and moon watching, when mooncakes are regarded as an indispensable delicacy mooncakes are offered between friends or on family gatherings while celebrating the festival the mid autumn festival is one of the four most important chinese festivals" title="Chinese Mooncakes" width=2236 height=1341 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/mooncake-china-1666548539.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Cheryl Chan</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">The full moon means more for China because it symbolizes a family reunion in Chinese tradition. During the Moon Festival, Chinese families get together, celebrate, and give thanks for a good harvest. Sound familiar? But where Americans have one day, China takes three. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, families hold a three-day feast complete with lantern lighting, dragon dancing, and mooncake making.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Mooncakes, not to be confused with the MoonPies of Mobile, are pastries filled with sweet bean or lotus seed paste. Because the festival takes place during the Harvest Moon, the full moon closest to the Autumnal Equinox, these pies are also sacrificed to the one in the sky.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">Japan</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">This one is closer to a U.S. September holiday. Japan celebrates Kinrõ Kansha no Hi or "Labor Thanksgiving Day" every November 23. Like Labor Day in the U.S., Kinrõ Kansha no Hi is a public holiday to honor workers in the community.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">There aren't big meals or parades, but one of the largest events is the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://thejapaneseshop.co.uk/blogs/japan/celebrating-labour-thanksgiving-day-in-japan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nagano Labour Festival" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Nagano Labour Festival</a> sponsored by local organizations that bring awareness to environmental and human rights issues. In another tradition, elementary-age children make crafts for labor workers such as police officers, firefighters, and hospital staff.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">Liberia</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">According to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.npr.org/transcripts/247691906 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=NPR class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">NPR</a>, Liberia is the only other country that officially celebrates Thanksgiving. It marks when freed American slaves founded the country in 1822 and takes place on the first Thursday of November. Depending on who you ask, Liberians may choose to attend a church service followed by a meal with family or use it as a day of relaxation. There are no official traditional foods eaten during Thanksgiving in Liberia, but some staples include rice, yams, collard greens, and cassava.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">South India</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">If you thought your family's Thanksgiving traditions were elaborate, Pongal has you beat. Southern Indians, the Tamil, thank the Sun god, nature, and everyone and every animal who supports agriculture by hosting a four-day festival.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">They observe it during the Tamil month Thai, which typically falls around January, but since it's based on the solar calendar it can vary. According to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.businessinsider.in/india/news/pongal-festival-is-related-to-this-state-here-is-its-origin-story/articleshow/88830723.cms data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Business Insider" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Business Insider</a>, 'Pongal,' which translates to "overflowing" is a traditional dish made with milk, ghee, and rice. The Tamil culture regards it as a symbol of prosperity associated with abundance and affluence. During this festival of harvest, families share elaborate meals together, give thanks, dance, and say prayers.</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">Ghana</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">After suffering through a time of famine in the 16th century, the Ga people were finally blessed with rain to grow their crops and celebrated with a feast. This grew into a tradition known as the Homowo Festival. Homwow, which means <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://travelnoire.com/homowo-festival-ghanas-version-of-thanksgiving data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='"hooting at hunger"' class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">"hooting at hunger"</a> in the Ga language, stretches over three months from May until August. Traditional dances, singing, and street parades take place during this time. Of course, food is featured throughout including palm nut fish soup, yams, and a corn powder dish.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLvUp6ursZyew6q6xmeaqKVfobansY6epa2doqmuqrrMnqWtZ5FpfnZ8lmtwbWenna61ecKorKesop6ytHnCnqOemqKWwaZ506GYp6OjnLa3tc2gZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
