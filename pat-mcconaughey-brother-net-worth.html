So it is hard to determine his actual net worth without having knowledge of his professional career.&nbsp;Talking about his brother Matthew has a net worth of around <strong>$140 Million</strong> according to celebrity net worth. Matthew, in fact, is also an award-winning actor. Likewise, his other brother Rooster has a net worth of around <strong>$55 million </strong>as of 2022.</p><p>Rooster is an actor and a businessman as well. He turned down what would have been a then-career-high <strong>$15 million</strong> to appear in a reboot film version of&nbsp;Magnum P.I. in the year 2008.&nbsp;Matthew can command <strong>$15-20 million</strong> for a major motion picture film role today as one of the industry’s biggest stars and biggest box office draws.&nbsp;His other brother <span class="LrzXr kno-fv">Rooster McConaughey has an estimated net worth of <strong>$65 million</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span id=What_is_Pat_McConaughey_Relationship_Status>What is Pat McConaughey Relationship Status?</span></h2><p>Well, talking about his personal life, there is no information on whether he is married or single.
