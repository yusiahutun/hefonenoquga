The singer and wife Caroline Bryan are preparing for date night as a series of unfortunate events keep sending him back to to the washing machine.
This is the second of two commercials the couple has done for Jockey. In the first they chose their favorite style of underwear for Bryan. This time he's in a T-shirt, much to Caroline's approval — she even tells him to wear it for their date."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"I'd like to see him model them," she says at the end.</p><p>Look for Bryan (fully clothed) at the 2020 ACM Awards in Nashville next Wednesday (Sept. 16). The CBS broadcast begins at 8PM ET and&nbsp;he is set to perform his latest No. 1, "One Margarita," from the Grand Ole Opry House. It's one of three venues chosen for the show, which will be hosted by Keith Urban.</p><p><h2 class=photogallery-title>10 Things You Didn't Know About Luke Bryan</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpa2bmnqjvtiapWain5i4psWMnKampZWnsKqty2auop6VYrGiwMRmpaKfmKl8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
