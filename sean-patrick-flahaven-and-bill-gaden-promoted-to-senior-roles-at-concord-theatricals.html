Sean has done a great job of building and integrating the elements of our theatricals business, and providing thoughtful and articulate leadership; Bill played a key role in the growth of Concord Music Publishing and now gets to focus again on his love for theater; and Vicky, Michelle and Imogen are all exceptional executives who make Concord Theatricals the best in the industry. We remain optimistic and determined about the future, committed to serving all of our creative partners and our staff through this difficult period.”</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ31wfJJoampno5qur3nPmquroZOgeqe4wKGYr52eYq6vsIyboKWkXZyupbHNZqerp52kwaawjK2mZquVo7awvoyrpqWdo2KutXnCqKWcp6KZerW0xJqrq6GTlrm0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
