After reliving the grisly murder scene of Ashley Pearson over a two-day trial, Judge Dal Williamson sentenced Adam Mills to life in prison. A jury of four white women, five black women, two white men and one black man deliberated for two hours before finding him guilty of first-degree murder. The jury reviewed the horrific crime scene in body-cam footage, crime-scene photos, autopsy photos and heard from seven witnesses before determining Mills’ fate."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

A jury of four white women,&nbsp;five black women, two white men and one black man deliberated for two hours before finding him guilty of first-degree murder. The jury reviewed the horrific crime scene in body-cam footage, crime-scene photos, autopsy photos and heard from seven witnesses before determining Mills’ fate.</p><p>There were so many stab&nbsp;wounds, “They couldn’t even&nbsp;count them,” Assistant District&nbsp;Attorney Kristen Martin said&nbsp;during closing arguments.</p><p>“The horror that she went&nbsp;through was unimaginable, and&nbsp;she didn’t die immediately,”&nbsp;she continued. “She lay there&nbsp;and bled to death.”</p><p>Tears streamed down the&nbsp;faces of family members as the</p><p>images were shown in court&nbsp;to show the deliberate design behind Mills’ grisly slaying of Pearson. Martin said she had never seen anything as horrific like this before.</p><p>“The only thing I can compare this to is the Helter Skelter killings by Charles Manson,” Martin said in closing arguments. The autopsy indicated that Pearson had both blunt-force and sharp-force injuries, severe ones to her head, chest and abdomen. She had been beaten in the head, her neck slashed, &nbsp;her heart stabbed and her torso completely separated from her lower body.</p><p>The killing took place&nbsp;June 4, 2020, when the&nbsp;Jones County Sheriff’s Department was dispatched to&nbsp;20 Powers Drive with the&nbsp;report of a possible suicidal man, later identified&nbsp;as Mills. When deputies&nbsp;arrived, they found Mills&nbsp;walking the street naked,&nbsp;covered in blood, testimony&nbsp;revealed. Mills rushed the&nbsp;deputies and was hit with&nbsp;a non-lethal shotgun and&nbsp;taser to subdue him. While&nbsp;medical personnel tried to&nbsp;tend to Mills’ wounds, he&nbsp;struggled on the ground as&nbsp;a deputy held him down and tased him again.</p><p>After getting Mills medical attention, deputies&nbsp;went into the home to discover the horrific scene.&nbsp;Blood was in the living&nbsp;room, children’s room&nbsp;and in the kitchen. In the&nbsp;laundry room, deputies&nbsp;found Pearson’s body, cut&nbsp;in half and in a pool of her&nbsp;blood. No one else was in&nbsp;the residence at the time&nbsp;of the murder.</p><p><strong>Before the murder</strong></p><p>Just before Pearson was&nbsp;murdered, she called her and Mills'&nbsp;friend Jon Michael Dearman for help to calm down&nbsp;Mills. Dearman came to&nbsp;the Mills’ home. When he&nbsp;arrived, he found Pearson&nbsp;crying because, testimony&nbsp;showed, Mills had cheated&nbsp;on her. When Dearman&nbsp;tried to calm Mills down,&nbsp;he “put a knife to his own&nbsp;neck and started stabbing&nbsp;at the floor.”</p><p>"Then it was like he started to fight something invisible to me and Ashley," Dearman said.&nbsp;</p><p>Dearman&nbsp;testified that Pearson tried&nbsp;to get the knife away from&nbsp;him before his demeanor&nbsp;changed.</p><p>“I saw something change&nbsp;in him and Ashley jumped&nbsp;like a foot in the air before&nbsp;running toward the laundry room,” Dearman said.&nbsp;“Then he ran after her and&nbsp;I decided to leave. Something told me to get out&nbsp;of there, and I locked the&nbsp;door behind me to give me&nbsp;a little bit more time.”</p><p>Dearman then called 911&nbsp;stating that Mills was suicidal. Dearman went back to his home and that’s when&nbsp;deputies found Mills naked in the roadway, screaming obscenities at them. Later, John Stevenson, a toxicologist with the Mississippi Forensics Laboratory, testified that Mills had benzodiazepines,&nbsp;amphetamines, methamphetamine, marijuana and cocaine in his system at&nbsp;the time of the murder.</p><p><strong>Getting closure</strong></p><p>After the verdict, the&nbsp;family gasped in relief, shedding tears with&nbsp;Ashley’s mother, Loretta&nbsp;Pearson hugging Jones&nbsp;County Sheriff’s Department employees and district attorney’s staff.</p><p>Williamson said the day&nbsp;was a tragic day for the&nbsp;family and friends of Ashley Pearson and for Mills’&nbsp;family.</p><p>“Mr. Mills, you made&nbsp;some terrible choices and&nbsp;I wish you hadn't made those choices,” Williamson said. “Your choices have led to horrifying,&nbsp;shocking results and has resulted not only in the loss of life of a young lady but a tragedy for her family and her friends as well.”</p><p>“We just wanted justice&nbsp;today for our daughter,”&nbsp;said Don Nicky, Pearson’s</p><p>father. “I have patience, but her mother, she’s just&nbsp;been crying since this&nbsp;happened every single&nbsp;day. It hurt me to see (the&nbsp;photos and video), but it&nbsp;hurt her mother more.”</p><p>Loretta Pearson said she&nbsp;was thankful for the guilty&nbsp;verdict.</p><p>“Praise God for that&nbsp;and the support from my&nbsp;family and friends,” she</p><p>said. “Maybe I can move&nbsp;on. The pain is still going&nbsp;to be there for a while, but&nbsp;I’m going to make it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcMDHnmSoppyuerW0yKeeZqFdmK6vecKopKmZopp6tbTIrGStp12ewG7Ax55koZ2cqbKzedKknKWslad6rLXLpaCnn6Nir7p5wqGYq6SVqHyivtOimqWdj22wd37EaWeaZZSZs3F5kGqcnGWSmX%2BkeY9wmJ1wlZiyp7KQnWWhrJ2h</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
