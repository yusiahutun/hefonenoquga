The ZZ Top cover is a distinct spin on the guitar-fueled original. And with Morgan's whiskey-soaked vocals and standout musical accompaniment, it's a cover that's bound to get the boots tapping along. A steady groove and memorable guitar riffs alongside Morgan's deep voice and ear-grabbing slide guitar give the song a more haunting feel than the original."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"The guitar riff is pure Billy Gibbons genius. I can’t wait to play it live every night."</p><p>Morgan produced his forthcoming project in the Neve Room at Sonic Ranch Studios in Tornillo, Texas. In addition to the striking ZZ Top cover,&nbsp;he worked with songwriters Travis Meadows and Ward Davis&nbsp;on new tracks featured on the upcoming release.</p><p>"It’s not like my vision happened overnight. I’ve been chipping away at it forever. It’s slowly evolving and it’s going in a little bit different direction. It’s not so straightforward anymore. This record definitely has a wider path, it’s broader, but it still sounds like a Whitey Morgan record," the frontman says of the album.</p><p><strong>Whitey Morgan and the '78's "Just Got Paid" Lyrics:</strong></p><p>I just got paid today / Got me a pocket full of change / Said, I just got paid today / Got me a pocket full of change / If you believe like workin' hard all day / Just step in my shoes and take my pay</p><p>I was born my papa's son / When I hit the ground I was on the run / I had one glad hand and the other behind / You can have yours, just give me mine / When the hound dog barkin' in the black of the night / Stick my hand in my pocket, everything's all right</p><p>I just got paid today / Got me a pocket full of change / Said, black sheep, black, do you got some wool? / Yes, I do, man, my bag is full / It's the root of evil and you know the rest / But it's way ahead of what's second best</p><p><strong>Best Country Songs of 2018 (So Far):&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmsKCZqbK6ecyoqaCZnmK3tr%2FTZp6orF2lrqqwjJymr52iZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
