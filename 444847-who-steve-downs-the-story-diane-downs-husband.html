And because of this, they formed a profound connection that matured <a href=# title>into a relationship</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1cd134c43c6ba9c4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Katie Holmes: Tom Cruise divorce story, dating, children, wedding</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After completing high school, Steve Downs went to join the Navy while Elizabeth Diane attended the Pacific Coast Baptist Bible College. However, Elizabeth was expelled from the religious institution as she didn't conform to the school's strong religious values. And she went back to her parent's home in Arizona.</p><h2>When did Steve Downs and Diane marry?</h2><p class=align-left>It seems like Steve and Diane were meant to be together. When they graduated from <a href=#>high school</a>, the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">two reunited </a>and rekindled their love despite their brief separation. But unfortunately, Diane's parents never approved of the relationship as they had high hopes for their daughter's future, which they did not see in Steve.</p><p class=align-left>Nevertheless, Steve and Diane tied the knot on November 13, 1973. Diane was 18 years old at the time and had run away from home to get married. However, their marriage wasn’t as great as they anticipated as Steve was a player and quite irresponsible and immature at the time. They often argued about their financial issues and fought over infidelities.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5482574292cc6508.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mary Harvey: The untold story of Steve Harvey's ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Despite all these misgivings, they chose to stay strong in the marriage and had their first child, Christie Ann, in 1974.

Many people have wondered why the two separated after seven years of marriage.</p><p class=align-left>According to <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">various sources</a>, Steve chose to separate from his wife after discovering that Stephen Daniel, their third child, was the product of her wife's relationship with a colleague.</p><p class=align-left>By the time <a href=#>Danny</a> was born, they were having intense arguments about infidelity that Steve got convinced that he wasn’t his biological son. The discovery that he wasn’t his biological child made him leave <a href=#>the relationship</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Also, their union was turbulent ever since the beginning as Diane was reportedly disappearing with her children for long periods. Also, she became pregnant without Steve Downs' permission.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e02cee89d038c858.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Where are Danny and Christie Downs now? All the latest details</span></p></a><h2>What happened to Steve Downs’ children?</h2><p class=align-left>The story of Steve Downs' children is one of the most shocking to date. On May 19, 1983, Elizabeth Diane pulled over her car by the side of the road in Springfield, Oregon and <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">shot her children</a> multiple times with a 22-calibre pistol.</p><p class=align-left>And to make her story believable, she shot a round in her arm before going to the hospital, claiming that she was a victim of a terrible carjacking. The incident left Cheryl dead, Danny paralyzed from the waist down, and Christie suffering from a stroke that affected her speech.</p><p class=align-left>In the beginning, detectives believed Diane's story, but they were not prepared for the actual story narrated by Christie, who survived the incident.</p><p class=align-left>Steve Downs' wife had become ignorant of her children and often left them with her parents or ex-husband. She was more interested in the affection of men, which on that fateful day in 1983 gave her an idea.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/df5da3eff58cdff7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Melissa Lynn Henning-Camp: The heart-breaking story of Jeremy Camp's first wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>She met Robert "Nick" Knickerbocker and started having a relationship with him earlier. However, he had no interest in taking care of Diane’s children. And that is why Diane chose to murder her children to regain his affection.</p><h2>Where are Steve’s children now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/29f7f60421339144.jpg><p class=align-left>Steve’s surviving children had endured a horrifying experience performed by someone they loved and cared about. In 1984, the lead prosecutor in the Danie case, Fred Hugi and his wife, Joanne, chose to adopt the children (Christie and Danny). Christie was the primary witness in the case against her mother.</p><p class=align-left>So, why didn't Steve Downs get custody? The authorities believed that the children's father was not a good fit to look after the children after what they had endured when their mother tried to murder them. In addition, the children were suffering life-changing physical and mental trauma, which would take years to heal.</p><p class=align-left>Christie and Danny have no contact with their father, and they have completed their <a href=#>education</a>. Christie is a married woman and gave birth in 2005. Another significant development about the children is that Danny is great with computers but is still paralyzed from the bullet that hit his back but is leading a regular life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7694a50c12cbe620.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Carol Kane: Husband, kids, net worth, movies, personal life</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Christie's first child is a boy.
