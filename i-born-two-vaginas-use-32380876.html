with them.</p><p>Speaking about her boyfriends, Annie revealed: "I wouldn't say we have a sex schedule per se, but I don't have sex with them both on the same day – I feel like that's fair for them.</p><p>"Though they are separate vaginas, fluids could pass in between the two and I just feel like they would get upset if they knew.</p><p>"Guys seem to get upset about girls sleeping with two guys within a 24-hour period so I just thought it was for the best.</p><p>"There is a kind of schedule when it comes to making OnlyFans content compared to when we have like fun sex – though it isn't very strict I am still able to have fun with both my boyfriends on and off camera at different times.</p><p>"I still don't think it is cheating because I let my boyfriends use one vagina each, and I could probably sleep with them in closer proximity but I also don't feel like I need to."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

when she went to get a contraceptive coil fitted as a teenager.</p><p>She said: "I was a young woman, I was just starting to become interested in dating and exploring different parts of my body and I was suddenly told it was different to everyone else's.</p><p>"As a teenager, you want to be 'normal', and being told you weren't, was really quite scary."</p><p>By the time she went to university to study philosophy and religion a few years ago, Annie had learnt to open up – even using the quip "I have two vaginas" as an ice-breaker.</p><p>She said: "I really started to accept it.</p><p>"I stopped looking at it as a medical issue, and all the problems that could arise from having children, and instead something which was just a super-cool aspect of myself because of people's reactions, they would be shocked but also so interested.</p><p>"Now, I've completely embraced it and accepted it as part of myself, and I've never been more confident."</p><p><b><i>Want all the biggest Lifestyle
