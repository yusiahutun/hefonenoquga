Adjusting your skincare regimen to match the season might not seem important, but we spoke to two dermatologists who can confirm that skin does in fact have different needs during the summer.</span></p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><p><span>We got an extensive breakdown from </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Dr. Marie Hayag</span></a><span>, a board-certified dermatologist and the founder of Fifth Avenue Aesthetics, and </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Dr. Tiffany Libby</span></a><span>, a board-certified dermatologist and the director of Mohs Micrographic and Dermatologic Surgery at Brown University. Our experts also shared what your summer <a href=# id=auto-tag_skincare-routine data-tag=skincare-routine>skincare routine</a> should </span><i><span>look</span></i><span> like and which products work best for this hot season. From brands like Cetaphil, IT Cosmetics and La Roche-Posay, keep reading for what to add to your cart ASAP.</span></p><h2><b>Our Experts’ Top Picks</b></h2><h2><b>How does climate affect the skin?&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>This might be a no-brainer for some, but climate plays a huge role in the state of your skin and what it needs. “Varying temperatures, humidity levels and different UV indexes associated with different climates can bring changes to your skin’s complexion. Thankfully, you can help combat these by changing your skincare routine accordingly,” Dr. Hayag explains.</span></p><h2><b>How does skin change during summer specifically?</b></h2><p><span>In fall and winter, you likely tend to reach for thicker creams and lotions due to the brisk breeze and lower humidity levels that cause dry skin. Your skin might flake and become irritated as a result of this type of weather. On the flip side, in spring and especially in summer, increased humidity results in oilier skin. When your pores produce a ton of sebum, they can get clogged more easily and lead to breakouts.</span></p><p><span>Dr. Hayag adds that hotter temperatures and very humid air creates the perfect environment for bacteria to grow on your skin, which can give rise to infections and diseases. Additionally, “Strong ultraviolet (UV) rays during the summer are also very damaging to your skin,” she notes. “They can create sunspots, uneven skin texture and pigmentation across different areas of your body, and exposure to the sun and UV rays are the leading cause of skin cancer.” That’s all to say that a number of things can go wrong if you don’t alter your skincare routine and buy the right products.</span></p><h2><b>How should one adjust their skincare routine for the warmer months?</b></h2><p><span>To start your summer skincare journey, look for lighter skincare products that are gel and water-based. Make sure you dodge thick, oil-based formulas. Oftentimes, people with oily skin wonder if they even need to apply a moisturizer during the summer, since their skin is already naturally producing so much oil. But Dr. Hayag advises: “It is important to still use a moisturizer even with oily skin complexions during spring and summer, along with light cleansers and serums.”</span></p><p><span>You thought we forgot about </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>sunscreen</span></a><span>, didn’t you? Never!!! “Spring and summer months also have a higher UV index than autumn and winter, so it is important to apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF of at least 30 every day and to reapply every 2 hours on days where you are out in the sun for extended periods of time,” Dr. Hayag says.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Are there any product categories that you should avoid or use less of during the summer?&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>Though you’ve probably gotten comfortable with your winter skincare regimen, there are a couple of steps that you should stay away from or do less of in the warmer months. Dr. Hayag says you can leave behind your milky and creamy cleansers and instead go for more gentle cleansers. For example, pair </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>micellar water</span></a><span> with a lightweight, gel-based cleanser. The micellar water wipes away makeup, while the cleaner removes dirt from your skin.</span></p><p><span>For moisturizers, tuck away your thicker goops. Your skin simply doesn’t need that much deep hydration during the summer. Instead, “A broad-spectrum UVA/UVB sunscreen that can also act as a moisturizer is ideal for combatting sun damage while also keeping your skin refreshed and hydrated,” says Dr. Hayag.</span></p><h2><b>Are there any product categories that you should add to your skincare routine or use more of during the summer?&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>The one product everyone—literally, everyone—needs in their skincare routine is a good SPF. It doesn’t matter your skin type or needs, you just need one. “Using a moisturizer with SPF properties is perfect for the summertime, as it avoids using too many layers of product on your face while it also protects and moisturizes,” Dr. Hayag explains. “The key to summer skincare is to keep everything lightweight and minimal while putting stress on protection.” Essentially, less is more in the summer. There’s no need to cake your face in a 10-step skincare routine if you can help it.</span></p><p><span>Dr. Hayag also emphasizes the importance of using non-comedogenic formulas. These kinds of products don’t clog pores. Whether you’re shopping for skincare or makeup items, check for this buzzy word on the packaging because you don’t want to apply products that’ll cause congestion and thus acne.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Which ingredients should you look out for when buying summer skincare products?&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>Opt for products that are packed with </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>vitamin C</span></a><span>, an antioxidant Dr. Hayag suggests you use year-round. “Using products containing antioxidants and vitamin C under sunscreen provides an extra layer of protection against the harmful UV rays. Vitamin C also helps increase collagen production and treat hyperpigmentation for a plumper, more even skin complexion,” says. Dr. Hayag. She also adds that hyaluronic acid is a top-notch hydrator that moisturizes and plumps.</span></p><h2><b>Which ingredients should you avoid when buying skincare products?</b></h2><p><span>The last thing you want for your skin in the summertime is to damage it. This can lead to your skin being more vulnerable to external aggressors and sunlight. The ingredients you should use less frequently in the summer are alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs), which you’ll typically find in chemical peels and exfoliators.</span></p><p><span>“AHAs and BHAs help get rid of wrinkles and hyperpigmentation; however, they make your skin more photosensitive and prone to sun damage,” notes Dr. Hyag. “Other ingredients that also make your skin more photosensitive include citrus oils in facial oils and physical scrubs that can not only make your skin more sensitive to sun damage but also other various external aggressors such as humidity, hot temperatures and chemicals in your environment,” she adds.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Lastly, steer clear of oily products that incorporate skincare butters, silicone or coconut oil, since they have a tendency to congest your pores, according to Dr. Hyag.</span></p><h2><b>In what order should you be applying skincare products in the summertime?&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>The keys to effective daytime skincare during the summer are gentle and lightweight formulas. Here are the exact steps you should follow, according to Dr. Hayag:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li aria-level=1><span>A </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>gentle cleanser</span></a><span> that removes oil</span></li><li aria-level=1><span>A </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>serum</span></a><span> with antioxidants like vitamins C and E products, since they help enhance UV protection&nbsp;</span></li><li aria-level=1><span>A </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>light moisturizer</span></a><span> that is not oil-based, and one that ideally contains sun protection and humectants.</span></li><li aria-level=1><span>A </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>sunscreen</span></a><span> that has a minimum of SPF 30 protection, if your moisturizer doesn’t have any sun protection in it.</span></li></ul><p><span>Your nighttime skincare must-haves will look slightly different from your morning essentials.
