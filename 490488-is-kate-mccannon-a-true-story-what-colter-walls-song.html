What to know about Colter Wall's song</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-03-10</div><p class=align-left><strong>For decades, country music has never shied away from producing murder ballads. Musicians release these subgenres of traditional ballads because they are the oldest form of crime literature. People usually listen to them because the songs are the first place to get cheap thrills based on a true story. Then, you have Kate McCannon, a murder ballad telling the story of a love gone wrong. But is <i>Kate McCannon</i> a true story?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/049049513a6ce665.jpg><p class=align-left><i>Kate McCannon</i> is a murder ballad by Canadian singer, songwriter, and <a href=#>musician</a><i> </i>Colter Wall. The song tells the story of a man behind bars giving a chronological order of events of how he met a beautiful girl called Kate McCannon, fell in love with her, and later killed her.</p><p class=align-left>It has received praise, particularly because of Wall's deep voice and the dark side of the lyrics. Also, the song touches on issues that have always engulfed society, including infidelity and murder.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8af0af086944015f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of Catfish stars who died and their causes of death</span></p></a><h2>Is Kate McCannon a true story?</h2><p class=align-left><i>Kate McCannon</i> is a song not based on a true story. Instead, it is a<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> murder ballad </a>that touches on the themes of anger and infidelity. Furthermore, the song is a testament to how infidelity and violence can easily entrap hardworking people in the lower class.</p><p class=align-left>Traditionally,<a href=#> country musicians</a> took stories from newspaper headlines to produce murder ballads. While most of those stories were true, they kept changing some things to get a good rhyme scheme. But, the songs were only partially true. However, one cannot deny that the stories were full of unpleasant truths and the tough reality that violence still exists in society.</p><p class=align-left>That form of traditional play inspired Colter Wall to release <i>Kate McCannon</i>. However, the story sounds real because it is intense and compelling. Furthermore, Kate McCannon's real story appears true because cases of murder, where one partner finds another cheating and shoots them, have been common in society for many decades.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/56b57511c8b74b1b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 meanest celebrities in real-life according to fans</span></p></a><p class=align-left><i>Kate McCannon</i> received wide praise, particularly because of Wall's voice. Despite being a song in his debut album, he conveyed emotions through the lyrics and outstanding vocal performances. On the other hand, the official video makes the whole story come out alive.</p><p class=align-left>Like the song, the <a href=#>music video</a> plays out the entire storyline. It features a young lower-class couple falling in love. Unfortunately, infidelity creeps into their relationship, leading to murder and the eventual arrest of the perpetrator. However, the video's components and the singer's melancholy vocals in the background make the story compelling.</p><h2>What is the Kate McCannon storyline?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8af0af086944015f.jpeg><p class=align-left><i>Kate McCannon</i> is a song sung from the perspective of a man serving time in prison. The man begins by explaining how a raven is a wicked bird floating outside his prison window. But in this context, the raven means the violence he sees around him and how it led to the murder of Kate McCannon. His story is more of a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">death-row confession</a>, underscoring the immorality of the murder ballad genre.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5719873cfb67a196.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cennet cast real names, episodes, full story, how to watch</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When he worked in the mines, the man first met Kate McCannon's father, TomMcCannon. Tom told the man that he had a dark-haired daughter, Kate McCannon, with long green eyes. And when the man finally met Kate McCannon at a creek, he thought she was the<a href=#> prettiest girl</a> in town.</p><p class=align-left>The couple courted, and he got a job that stopped him from rumbling. He would save a quarter of his pay every day to buy Kate McCannon a diamond ring. But things were only sometimes good. One day, he went home to look for Kate. But unfortunately, he did not find her at home.</p><p class=align-left>He went to the creek where they first met. But when he reached the creek, he found Kate with another lover. Angry and frustrated, the man shot and killed Kate - And I put three rounds into Kate McCannon. Now, the man is older and behind bars narrating a love gone wrong.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/73a3535430f43087.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top details about The Chi season 3: full cast members and characters list, episodes</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The unique factor about the storyline is that it is short and never finishes. Thus, it only encourages the listener to come up with their own conclusion. But even without framing a conclusion, it does not leave the listener unsatisfied.</p><h2>Is Kate McCannon glorifying violence against women?</h2><p class=align-left>For many years, murder ballads have involved a<a href=#> male character</a> killing a female character. And while Colter Wall received intense criticism for his song, he admits that he was not looking to glorify violence against women or follow in that direction.</p><p class=align-left>Colter Wall admits that he did not think he was trying to reinvent the murder ballad. And since songwriting is about creativity, Wall tried to put his own spin on a topic that has traditionally depicted an act of violence against women.</p><h3>When did Kate McCannon come out?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/56b57511c8b74b1b.jpg><p class=align-left>Colter Wall released the song <i>Kate McCannon</i> in 2017. The song is also from his self-titled album, released the same year. However, the dark, twisted video, which became the song's official video, was released two years later.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bcf4105f572a62bc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 sad classic rock songs of all time</span></p></a><h3>Who are the casts in Colter Wall's Kate McCannon video?</h3><p class=align-left>The<i> Kate McCannon</i> video actress is Leann Mayo, the boyfriend is Christian Nulty, and the man she had an affair with is Bill Heneghan. A unique factor about the cast is that they were not actors. Instead, the directors, Alexa King and Stephen Kinigopoulos filmed the video with friends and <a href=#>family</a> members.</p><p class=align-left>The directors got the approval to film it from Colter Wall after contacting him through social media. Also, the entire shot location is within their neighbourhood.</p><p class=align-left>So, is Kate McCannon a True Story? Well, Kate McCannon is not a true story. Instead, it is a murder ballad that tells the chronological events of how a young man met and fell in love with Kate McCannon. The man used some of his savings to buy a diamond ring for Kate.

Tshala started her career as a musician in the late 1970s. She sang both traditional African rhythms with modern Western sounds to produce some of the best songs ever played. Through her hard work, she became the most successful <a href=#>female musician</a> in Africa. She died on 10 December 2022, aged 64, in Kinshasa, DRC.</p><p class=align-left>Tshala was a Congolese singer and songwriter.
