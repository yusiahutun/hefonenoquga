She has interviewed some of the world’s biggest names and deals with the pressures of live TV on Good Morning Britain.
She juggles that with being a mum to Darcey, ten, and seven-year-old William, and wife to ex-political adviser Derek Draper.
But on the cusp of turning 50, she faces another adventure – middle age."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Her answer was that she and her husband had been engaged in the “14-day sex challenge”.</p><p>According to Sylvie, everyone in Paris is doing it.</p><p>The rules are simple — you must have sex once a day for two weeks, no matter how inconvenient or unromantic the situation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000306741695-e1488747094546.jpg><p>It can be over in seconds or last an hour, it can be in the bedroom or the kitchen...or anywhere else.</p><p>The idea is to put sex back as the focus of your relationship.</p><p>I was intrigued. When you’ve been with someone for a very long time, even though you still love them and fancy them, you may not be making space for the act of love.</p><p>Some days my husband Derek and I barely have time for a conversation about anything apart from the business of life — who’s picking up who and who’s cooking dinner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000306732824.jpg><p>He has always been very romantic, but over the course of a fortnight you don’t always find the time.</p><p>So I was ready to give Sylvie’s challenge a try.</p><p>When I told Derek he was nonplussed. “You mean, sex every two weeks?” he said nervously.</p><p>But when he got the idea, he was all for it.</p><p>Derek is a very practical person — so he sat down and made a spreadsheet. Oh, the romance.</p><p>We did something similar when I was on Strictly and had to squeeze in rehearsals, a full-time job and toddler, but this was different. An adventure just for us.</p><p>Once the schedule was established, it was time to get down to business.</p><p>Day one went well. It was rather fun, actually.</p><p>Day two was not so good, when a nightmare about Harry Potter’s fight with Voldemort brought our seven-year-old down into our bed.'</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000005274128-e1488747471804.jpg><p>On day three we had a whole blissful hour to ourselves.</p><p>On day four Derek suddenly had an extra meeting scheduled so we were seriously squeezed for time.</p><p>On day five I discovered I like tickling. On day six I discovered that he didn’t.</p><p>On day seven I bought a new set of underwear, thinking it would come as a nice surprise.</p><p>But it wasn’t as easy to get off as get on and the bra clasp got caught in my hair.</p><p>It turned into a farce — but we laughed.</p><p>I found I was really enjoying myself. It was an adventure.</p><p>Even planning it and trying to make it work seemed to make us giggle.</p><p>Then disaster struck on day eight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000280574323.jpg><p>I’d like to say it was down to my spectacular acrobatics, but unfortunately not.</p><p>Derek had told me to take a long bubble bath, with lots of candles, while he took the kids to the park — lovemaking scheduled for later.</p><p>But when he came home his face was ashen. He’d slipped on wet leaves and needed to go to A&E.</p><p>Four hours later he emerged with four broken bones, a full leg of plaster, a wheelchair and instructions “not to put any pressure on the foot at all, possibly for as long as three months”.</p><p>Never mind swinging from the chandelier, just standing under a chandelier would be impossible.</p><p>Our 14-day challenge had stalled. But it wasn’t cancelled.</p><p>The time we’d blocked out for sex was there, so we used it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict0003004884572.jpg><p>Instead of wild lovemaking, I would sit and chat with Derek instead, and look after him, which was lovely in itself.</p><p>We just had a giggle about it all and decided to book a trip to Rome for my birthday — and do it properly then.</p><p>So maybe the challenge didn’t work out exactly as we expected but it was a valuable lesson.</p><p>We laughed a lot, which was a good reminder that sex isn’t just another chore to tick off.</p><p>But it also reminded me that you can’t assume things, even sex, will just happen without time and effort.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN SHOWBIZ</h2></p><p>It can be easy to let all sorts of things in your life slide, including your relationship.</p><p>A step as small as reserving 20 minutes together every day can stop that.</p><p>When it comes to letting things slide, I had a wake-up call last August.</p><p>We were moving house and I’d been packing up boxes and lugging them up and down stairs all week.</p><p>I started to get shooting pains in my chest, the sort you can’t ignore, so called my GP.</p><p>I was expecting them to tell me it was nothing — but instead they said I should go straight to A&E.</p><p>It turned out I had just torn the cartilage around my ribs, so nothing major, but that, combined with turning 49, suddenly made me feel very frightened about what was coming down the line.</p><p>I started to notice things about my appearance that I didn’t like — the crepey skin on the backs of my hands, deep furrows between my brows, my awful jowls.</p><p>I found myself staring in the mirror and pulling back my skin as if I’d had a facelift — wondering if<br>I’d look much better, more like the old me.</p><p>I became a bit obsessed with it but there were people, including my husband, who convinced me not to throw myself under the surgeon’s knife.</p><p>I started transforming myself in other ways — ditching sugar from my diet, taking up the gym and experimenting with less drastic cosmetic procedures like a soft peel on my face.</p><p>Crucially, I also tackled practical concerns like money and health in old age.</p><p>Plus spiritual and emotional ones — like facing up to the loss of loved ones as we get older, and our own mortality.</p><p>And it’s had a big effect.</p><p>Of course, feeling good about the way I look still matters to me.</p><p>I’m not ruling out surgery completely — never say never — but the changes I have made have given me a lot more energy and made me calmer about ageing.</p><p>I turn 50 in May. Ageing can be frightening, there’s no doubt.</p><p>But I’m ready for the challenge — after taking on the 14-day sex challenge, how hard can it be?</p><p>Asking Dame Helen Mirren in 2015 about a camping trip, Kate could not see her “getting down” in a tent. Helen replied: “That sounds rather rude.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000306320691.jpg><p><strong>• The Joy of Big Knickers, by Kate Garraway (Blink Publishing), is out on Thursday.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhrYGaEcYSPaJ6op5RiurC%2BzaKloGWSp7a1rcinZKmqlaiyr8DEq2SkmaSaeqit0auYsJmpYr%2BmwsSao6xlmJq%2Fbq3TrZymqKSoeqLAjKynopuZo7Ruwc9mn56qXaKus77Imp6eZZmjerSt1JywZp2oqb%2Bir9OsZJ%2Bqn6J6r7HWZpmop5tiwamxjKOmsmWfm3qjtcZmoqehk6Cys7%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
