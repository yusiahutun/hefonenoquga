I've a product called <span><a aria-label="overnight facial" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Overnight Facial</a></span> and you massage it into the skin during facials and leave it to sink in and it gives the skin an incredible juicy glow to it.

We were desperate to know: Is it ever ok to squeeze them? How can we reduce them and is it possible to get rid of enlarged pores forever? She also reveals whether diet makes a difference to pores and recommends some fab pore-busting products. Here's Sarah's expert advice…</p><h2>What causes enlarged pores?</h2><p id=eZiDFk9xshNY data-wc=83>Sarah says: "A build-up of oil or dirt in the skin can contribute to making pores appear enlarged as they become blocked and the skin around the pore dilates. People with naturally more <a class=hm-link href=#>oily skin</a> are likely to have bigger pores because their oil glands are more active, meaning they need a bigger pore to release oil from within the skin. In these cases, a thorough cleansing routine can have a big impact on the appearance of the pores, helping to reduce blockages and breakouts.</p><p id=eUcP_poi-Pj_ data-wc=2><strong>FIND OUT: <a class=hm-link href=#>How to do your makeup if you have oily skin</a></strong></p><p id=e22AraBZM2VJ data-wc=1><strong>RELATED: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Aldi's sellout beauty buys are back in stock – but you'd better be quick!</a></p><p id=ehcLeRT68Abn data-wc=31>"Age can also have an impact on pore size as collagen begins to break down in the skin, creating a lack of elasticity and tautness which causes the pores to dilate."</p><h2>Should you ever deal with blackheads/whiteheads yourself or is it best to visit a professional?</h2><p id=en4Zr_PLx3e5 data-wc=52>"It is of course not advisable to pop your spots for risk of scarring, but since I know that people do, my advice is to do it safely. The main reason for recommending a professional extraction is that it is hygienic, but there are ways you can mimic this process at home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d12f57cd2ebf-ultimate-cleanse-z.jpg><p id=eZwTVhHDbC8b data-wc=5><strong>Sarah Chapman Ultimate Cleanse, £54, <span><a aria-label="ultimate cleanse" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Cult Beauty</a></span></strong></p><h6><span><a aria-label="ultimate cleanse" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><p id=ehK1aOgjddir data-wc=62>"First wash your hands. Then begin by using a facial steamer to open the pores and prepare the skin – or have a bath or shower. Apply a balm cleanser like my <span><a aria-label="sarah chapman" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Ultimate Cleanse</a></span> to the whole face, using massage techniques to work it deeper into the skin, and then circle the blemish with the pads of your fingers to soften the blockage further.</p><p id=eD2I8OtZ4wvl data-wc=52>"Apply a warm flannel to the affected area and start to apply gentle pressure with a wiggle to either side of the blemish, stopping immediately if you see any blood. It is important to always use your fingers and to avoid using your nails, as this can cause trauma to the skin."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7ecf8a4ce77f-pores-z.jpg><p id=exQIsg1YoXzF data-wc=11><strong>Targeted skincare products will help reduce the appearance of large pores</strong></p><h2>Can you ever get rid of large pores or just reduce them?</h2><p id=eFN28Pa4eBvZ data-wc=57>"Since enlarged pores are largely determined by genetics we can never physically reduce the pore size, but we can of course work to effectively minimise their appearance by keeping them clear and free from a build-up of dirt and dead skin cells. Treatments such as peels, deep <a class=hm-link href=#>microneedling</a> and some lasers can have a visible effect on pores."</p><p id=eoFNG_Fbmnde data-wc=1><strong>MORE: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>This is why pomegranate is the skincare ingredient you need this summer</a></p><h2>What skincare products help enlarged pores?</h2><p id=ecPVw8mHuWA0 data-wc=55>"Face-friendly acids, such as phytic acid, lactic acid and glycolic acid, have a resurfacing effect on the skin, digesting dead cells and stimulating cell renewal for a smoother skin appearance. Glycolic acid can be very effective but might be too harsh on some people’s skin, whereas lactic acid is ideal for people suffering with sensitivity.</p><p id=eGKt8Aj2lHiD data-wc=44>"P Refinyl is another pore-blasting active ingredient that works specifically to minimise the pores, leaving them looking smaller and tighter. These actives have the same effect on the skin as a physical exfoliant but avoid the need for harsh and scratchy ingredients like micro-beads."</p><p id=ek1TZtDwjK6e data-wc=2><strong>SKIN CARE: <a class=hm-link href=#>What are AHAs and BHAs and what's the difference?</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/538fc16ffb71-fish-eggs-z.jpg><p id=eqMjw83mJ2rL data-wc=11><strong>Eating a diet rich in omega and vitamin B2 can help</strong></p><h2>What products would you recommend for enlarged pores?</h2><p id=ed4-Xz6M_uzm data-wc=48>"My <span><a aria-label=chapman class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Liquid Facial Resurfacer</a></span> is expertly calibrated with phytic and lactic acids to gently exfoliate, unclog and refine the pores, without using micro-beads and other irritants that can tear the skin’s delicate surface. It also targets signs of ageing, sun damage and blemishes to reveal smoother, radiant and more-even toned skin.</p><p id=eyK1Zt9M2cov data-wc=70>"My <span><a aria-label=booster class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Overnight Exfoliating Booster</a></span> works in synergy with the skin’s own night-time cell-renewal process to eliminate dead skin cells.

It is categorised as a beta hydroxy acid (BHA), which means it is oil soluble and can penetrate deeper into the skin to exfoliate, unclog and tighten the pores. It can also help to reduce sebum secretion - the skin’s natural oil – to keep the skin balanced and prevent pores from enlarging beyond your genetic predisposition.</p><p id=eGnde6fqM0VF data-wc=65>"However, it should be used with caution. The main negative effect of salicylic acid is that it has the ability to irritate and dry the skin, which means it should not be over-used and the skin should be neutralised afterwards with an intense hydrator. It can also interfere with specific medication such as blood-thinners and is not recommended in high doses if you are pregnant."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bd6cebef9cfd-booster-z.jpg><p id=eCUMG-OQvvl9 data-wc=7><strong>Sarah Chapman Skinesis Overnight Exfoliating Booster, £64, <span><a aria-label="overnight exfoliating" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Space NK</a></span></strong></p><h6><span><a aria-label=chapman class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">SHOP NOW</a></span></h6><h2>Can diet help reduce the size of your pores?</h2><p id=ekbtbw8J1QNL data-wc=57>"Your <a class=hm-link href=#>diet</a> affects all aspects of your health and your pores are no exception. Following an anti-inflammatory diet can regulate excess oil to prevent breakouts and clogging. This involves controlling your blood sugar levels by avoiding sugary and starchy foods and focusing instead on omega-rich fish and foods full of vitamin B2, such as spinach, almonds and eggs."</p><p id=e5eI-yIIVc_8 data-wc=41>HELLO!'s selection is editorial and independently chosen – we only feature items our editors love and approve of.
