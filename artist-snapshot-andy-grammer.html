Known for his pop/rock/soul mix and free-flowing vocal delivery, the acclaimed singer, songwriter and musician–who began as a street performer in Santa Monica, CA–is poised to make 2012 another big year.

On tap are his follow-up single “Fine By Me”; his first headlining tour, with Ryan Starr supporting, launching January 13th in San Diego; and a live EP, Andy Grammer Live, for release in the first quarter."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

You’re selling out your headlining tour dates months in advance.</p><p>Explain your journey so far, from a busker in Santa Monica to gold-selling</p><p>status for “Keep Your Head Up” and headline performer?</p><p><br>“I am just too excited for words. You strive and strive to get to a place where</p><p>what you have created has momentum. I remember my mother telling me it was like</p><p>a snowball; you start small with your little half ice/half snow peanut and begin</p><p>rolling it. Gold records and sold-out shows… even just responding to that</p><p>question feels like, ‘you talking about me?’ The best part is the opportunities</p><p>I get with momentum. That I even get to play a sold-out show where people know</p><p>the words, and I'm singing about things I'm connected to is such blessing. It’s</p><p>the equivalent of a nine-year-old saying ‘I want to be an astronaut when I grow</p><p>up’ and then getting to go to the moon. This year I've been to the moon, and</p><p>it’s awesome.</p><p><br>2. What can fans expect from your headlining tour? What changes have you</p><p>incorporated since the Natasha Bedingfield show?</p><p><br>“I think for starters it’s a whole different mentality. It’s the difference</p><p>between an appetizer and the meal. An opener is like the preview when you sit</p><p>down at the movies. This tour is like, ‘and now…for our feature</p><p>presentation…’ The lights turn off and everyone is ready. It’s different. I</p><p>will play a longer set; I'm also bringing out a keyboard/guitar player with my</p><p>band this time and taking more chances musically. On headlining shows I think</p><p>people are more willing to go on a musical journey with you. If you play a slow</p><p>intense personal song as an opener, it can be a super downer. That same slow</p><p>song in a headlining set might be the pinnacle of the show. I'm really ready to</p><p>take a stab at that sort of pressure as well as the rewards that come with</p><p>it.”</p><p><br>3. “Fine By Me” is the follow-up to your hugely successful gold single “Keep</p><p>Your Head Up.” It’s already climbing the radio charts well before the impact</p><p>date. Can you talk about what inspired this song?</p><p><br>“’Fine By Me’ is about having my heart stolen. It’s a story about a girl who</p><p>came into my life and just robbed it right from under me. In my experience love</p><p>is an all-or-nothing emotion. We are all really protective of ourselves because</p><p>we know that if we fall in love we'll fall hard. So we kind of dance around the</p><p>edges with our tippy toes in the water playing it cool. I went from playing it</p><p>SO cool to falling SO hard in about four days. That’s what ‘Fine By Me's’</p><p>about.”</p><p><br>4. Various musicians do covers of your music–Hunter Hayes for example. Do you</p><p>have a favorite cover to perform?</p><p><br>“When I performed on the street, I really developed a love for playing covers.</p><p>Some people are cover snobs and only play original material but I LOVE covers,</p><p>especially if you can flip them and make them your own. I love to cover a beat-</p><p>boxing version of ‘Chasing Cars’ by Snow Patrol, ‘Apologize’ by One Republic,</p><p>‘Empire State of Mind’ by Jay-Z and Alicia Keys. Anything to keep people</p><p>guessing or bringing something new to the song that wasn't there. Whether that</p><p>is taking a piano song and rocking it on the guitar, or taking a rap song and</p><p>adding a melody to the words, I like to add something to it.”</p><p><br>5. You recently performed at a Billboard event in NYC and paid tribute to Taylor</p><p>Swift with an acoustic version of her hit "Mine" and dedicated "Keep Your Head</p><p>Up" to Nicki Minaj and the rest of the honorees. What do you feel artistically</p><p>about Swift and Minaj?</p><p><br>“Artistically they are both really on top of their games right now. What really</p><p>stands out is that their songs are incredible. Both of them have the ability to</p><p>get into the core of the listener and have them relate with their vulnerability</p><p>on such a consistent basis–it’s uncanny. It’s like a quarterback winning Super</p><p>Bowl after Super Bowl–it’s amazing. I also really admire the relationship they</p><p>have with their fans. Having performed with Taylor, I saw how much fans love</p><p>what she gives to them, and as I was leaving the Billboard event, there was a</p><p>huge group of Nicki fans cheering and screaming when she came out. They scream</p><p>because Nicki and Taylor gave them something they can't get anywhere else–a</p><p>vital piece of their day. I am in awe of that relationship between fan and</p><p>singer–and both of those ladies are masters of that.”</p><p><b><span>Andy Grammer</span></b><br>Availability: Call for</p><p>Availability<br><a href=#>http://www.andygrammer.com</a></p><p><b><span><u>Agency</u></span><br>Paradigm Talent & Literary Agency</b></p><p>Agency Relationship: Exclusive<br>360 Park Avenue South 16th Floor<br>New York, NY 10010 United States<br>Phone: 212-897-6400<br>Fax: 212-764-8941<br><a href=#>http://www.paradigmagency.com</a></p><p><span><b>Responsible Agent:</b></span> Jason Kupperman<br>Direct Phone: 212-897-6400<br>Fax: 212-764-8941<br>E-Mail: <a href=#>jkupperman@paradigmagency.com</a></p><p><b><span><u>Publicity</u></span></b></p><p>MSO PR / The Mitch Schneider Organization<br>14724 Ventura Boulevard Suite 500<br>Sherman Oaks, CA 91403 United States<br>Phone: 818-380-0400<br>Fax: 818-380-0430<br><a href=#>http://www.msopr.com</a></p><p><span><b>Responsible Publicist:</b></span> Todd Brodginski<br></p><p>Direct Phone: 818-380-0400<br>Fax: 818-380-0430<br>E-Mail: <a href=#>toddb@msopr.com</a></p><p><b><span><u>Record Label</u></span></b></p><p>S-Curve Records</p><p>825 8th Avenue 30th Floor<br>New York, NY 10019 United States<br>Phone: 212-445-3291<br>Fax: 212-445-3298<br><a href=#>http://www.s-curverecords.com/home</a><br></p><p><a href=#>Andy Grammer's tour dates</a></p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGiZoqm2tMCMrKWaqKOdvLV5wKebsmWXp66uucSrZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
