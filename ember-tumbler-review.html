While all of Ember’s other drinkware has some kind of character trait, the 16oz Tumbler is a little boring—from a purely visual standpoint.</p><p>However, holding the Tumbler in my hand presented a different picture of the self-heating container. Unlike all of the company’s other smooth drinkware products, this one has texture. The Tumbler was quite striking to hold and see in person.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Its “boring” style turned out to also be quite clever. It’s the largest capacity drinkware product of the bunch but still maintains a reasonable size because there are no extremities protruding. The exterior texture provides some grip instead of needing a handle. I had no problem holding the Tumbler without a handle and drinking from it.</p><p>Its size actually pulled me down a path of investigating all of Ember’s drinkware products. How did the company make a larger capacity product that still fits most cup holders and works with all previous charging coasters? I found the answer with the 10oz Mug 2.</p><p>Both the 10oz Mug 2 and the Tumbler have 3.3-inch wide measurements. Essentially, the company stretched the Mug 2 from 4.2 inches tall to 6.5 inches, and voila, the Tumbler was born. Interestingly, the Tumbler isn't the tallest drinking product, either.</p><p>I didn’t have any problem with the Tumbler’s height. But I also don’t think it could have been any taller for casual home use. As is, the container finds a happy medium to pull double duty at home or on the road and replace the need for two different cups.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When you do go out, there are two lids to choose between. The handle lid screws on for times you need to carry it more, but the internal threads are pushed down enough that your lips never touch them. I felt like I could have been drinking from any ol’ camp mug in this regard. The sipping lid uses a rubber gasket and pushes down to fit instead of screwing on or off. Both performed as advertised.</p><h2 id=the-features-of-a-smart-coffee-tumbler>The Features of a Smart Coffee Tumbler</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/d3d1ac14-6ed5-48ab-82a9-3e6357cc3b51-1.JPG> Sipping lid<p>Like most of Ember's other drinkware products, the Tumbler has a temperature range from 120F to 145F (50C to 62.5C). It uses a “smart” LED to indicate when it's warming, when the battery is charging or dying, and can show a personal color choice. The Tumbler has a three-hour rated battery life with auto sleep to turn it on or off, depending on if liquid is detected.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Tumbler comes with both the handle lid and sipping lid in the box. Both are advertised as leakproof. While at home, I didn’t use either lid. I thought drinking straight from the Tumbler felt nice, and I didn’t want to wash anything extra. However, I tried both lids out of the house and was pleased with having both available, depending on where I was going.</p><p>A charging coaster comes in the box, too, like with other Ember drinking products. The induction wireless charger here, however, has been slimmed down to take up less space on the counter or desk. The new one did save space for me and did look better, so I’m glad it shrunk, but in the end, I wasn’t using the coaster anywhere I hadn’t been able to before.</p><h2 id=software-and-battery-life>Software and Battery Life</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/520426cc-955c-43c1-b267-78f31a75e0df.JPG> Charging coaster the Tumbler sits on to recharge <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Ember drinkware products are infused with technology, there’s nothing that really needs to be operated. They simply assist while being used.</p><p>For example, mobile apps are available for <a href=#>iPhone</a> or <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Android</a> owners. But they don’t technically need to be used.</p><p>The Tumbler comes preset to warm to 135F when liquid is detected and then auto-shutoff when it's empty. Wash and repeat.</p><p>If you do want to customize the color LED or change the temperature it heats to, then the app is needed. Since the overall functions of the software are minimal, the app is pretty sparse, too.</p><p>There might not be a way to control the temperature from the Tumbler itself, but the Apple Watch app could fill that void for some people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Battery life is listed as three hours. Over the first few days, that seemed accurate for the Tumbler, based on following the battery percentage in the mobile app. While I don’t have long-term hands-on with this newest product, I have been using an original Ember Mug for about three years, and its battery still gets at least 75% of its original battery life.</p><p>I know the use cases for drinking coffee vary wildly, but I don’t want to drink the same cup three hours after I started it anyway. Even if it is still the right temperature.</p><h2 id=ember-tumbler-price-and-availability>Ember Tumbler Price and Availability</h2><p>The Ember Tumbler is only available in black at launch and <a href=#>retails for $199.95</a>. It's shipping now from the company and will be available at other retailers starting September 24, 2023.</p><h2 id=what-about-the-travel-mug-2-how-does-the-tumbler-compare>What About the Travel Mug 2? How Does the Tumbler Compare?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/eecd2541-6577-4bb9-9d13-934c94c13834-1.JPG> Ember Tumbler (left) compared to the Travel Mug 2 <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I appreciate what the Travel Mug, in all of its versions, has tried to do by taking the heating technology on the road. Even still, I have not cared for it. I haven’t liked its matte finish that shows fingerprints like crazy. I haven’t liked its invisible touch controls, which I always worry about pressing accidentally. I also haven’t been crazy about cleaning its press-button lid or narrow interior.</p><p>My guess is that most owners of the Travel Mug will say its ability to display the current temperature right on the mug itself is its killer feature. I did find that neat, but still not cool enough (or warm, I guess) to deal with the other things I wasn’t a fan of.</p><p>I would choose the Tumbler over the Travel Mug 2 any day of the week. The Travel Mug product isn’t bad, but in direct comparison, I don’t think it comes close to the Tumbler’s simplicity, ease of use, or elegance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=should-you-buy-the-ember-tumbler>Should You Buy the Ember Tumbler?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/054546b3-f347-4596-bf6b-8007cd0cde47-1.JPG> Tumbler fits in the Rivian R1S's cup holder<p>The <a href=#>Ember Tumbler</a> is the most expensive drinkware product the company has made, coming in at nearly $200. It worked perfectly as advertised, but its price can still be hard to get past. It seems like a terrible value.</p><p>On the flip side, I have used an Ember Mug pretty much every single day since the beginning of 2020. Maybe besides my iPhone, it’s the only product I can say I’ve used as much. It’s been a workhorse and provided immense value.</p><p>If I were coming new to Ember products right now, the Tumbler is the one I would be most tempted by because it can be used at home and on the road—the Mug can’t do that. I would justify it as two products in one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Tumbler may be a little heavy with a full 16 ounces of liquid inside, but other than that, I found nothing to complain about. (And I wasn’t crazy about the Cup or Travel Mug 2, by the way.) Justify its price if you can; otherwise, you might want to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">look at the less expensive Mug 2</a> as an option because these drinkware products really do change the game for slow or more deliberate coffee drinkers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ember_cm21xl_17-slate_handle_2048x-removebg-preview.png> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-ec_final.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>Ember Tumbler</h5><p class=display-card-description>Designed to be used wherever life takes you, the Ember Tumbler does more than simply keep your coffee hot.
