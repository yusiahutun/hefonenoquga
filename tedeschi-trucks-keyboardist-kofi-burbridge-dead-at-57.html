He as 57.</p><p>A statement posted to the Allman Brothers social media said: “The Allman Brothers Band Family lost another member last night, Kofi Burbridge. Kofi a master of keyboards and flute came into the family through his brother bassist Oteil. He died in Atlanta on February 15, following complications surrounding treatment for an ongoing cardiac issue. He regularly sat in with the Brothers, over 20 times listed on ABB web site, but there were more shows not listed. His warm smile, subtle personality and expert music skills made him a welcome addition every time he was at a show. Kofi had a standing invitation to play, some times he just came to watch, or wandered off. His flute solos on ‘Elizabeth Reed’ were unique and memorable. His keyboard contributions were masterful. Our broken hearts and grief go out to the Burbridge and Tedeschi Trucks Band families on the loss of Kofi. His memory, talent and contributions to music will be with us all forever.”</p><p>According to an obituary posted on Jambands, Burbridge died following complications surrounding treatment for a cardiac issue.</p><p>In 2017, he suffered a heart attack and underwent surgery to repair an aortic rupture and the band announced earlier this year that he had suffered a setback in his recovery.</p><p>“Unfortunately Kofi Burbridge has suffered a recent setback related to his surgery in 2017 and had to undergo a follow-up procedure last week. The doctors feel good about his recent progress and we’re hoping he’ll be out of the hospital soon, but he’ll need some time for recovery. TTB is fortunate to have a talented circle of friends/family to call on when a bandmate is in need, and renowned keyboardist Gabe Dixon made himself available to cover for Kofi while he gets better. We appreciate everyone’s best wishes for Kofi and we’re all looking forward to his healthy recovery and return to the stage where he belongs,” a rep for the band said in January.</p><p>A native of Bronx, Burbridge first made name for himself performing, along with his brother Oteil, with the Atlanta-based band Knee Deep. While the band was short-lived, it provided Kofi with an introduction to others in the local music scene, including Bruce Hampton.</p><p>Kofi would later go on to perform with Aquarium Rescue Unit, the Derek Trucks Band, and the Tedeschi Trucks Band, including on their Grammy Award-winning debut album Revelator.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZoZwfJFoaHJnpJqxpr%2FCoaBmrKKqsKy%2FjKScspqflr%2BltdKtZKSnlp56o8HRm6minJeaeqWxwJ1kmqxdaoRw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
