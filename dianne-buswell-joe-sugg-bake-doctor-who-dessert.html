And they're using only items they can find in their cupboards!</p><p id=eW0PX-_kex5y data-wc=13><strong>SEE:&nbsp;<span title="See inside Strictly Come Dancing pro Dianne Buswell's London home with Joe Sugg">Inside Strictly Come Dancing pro Dianne Buswell's London home with Joe Sugg</span></strong></p><p id=eW6yWzQZrCQV data-wc=120>Throughout the baking process, viewers were delighted to see Dianne and Joe's usual cheeky exchanges, including the funny moment when the professional broke one of the biscuits! As she was moving the baked treats from&nbsp;one surface to another, the delicate biscuit door snapped in half, prompting&nbsp;Joe to joke: "This is why you're too heavy-handed in the kitchen." Luckily, Dianne revealed it wasn't integral to the overall structure: "It's alright we have a few more in the oven." And the final Tardis cookie tower looks as though it belongs on - if it tastes as good as it looks, we imagine Dianne and Joe would have secured one of Paul Hollywood's iconic handshakes!</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p style=text-align:center id=eTZFLFTa30w1 data-wc=14><strong>WATCH:&nbsp;Dianne Buswell and Joe Sugg give a&nbsp;Charleston dance tutorial from their home</strong></p><p id=e1fM-86cbPzd data-wc=94>Dianne was unfortunately not as successful with her banoffee pie, which she tried to bake as a surprise for Joe over the weekend. While the biscuit base appeared to be welded onto the bottom of the pan, the caramel failed to set in the fridge. When asked what score he would give it out of ten, the 28-year-old replied, "The flavour? I'd give it a nine. It has a really nice banana flavour." However, he compared the consistency to phlegm! "You know what, because you made it I'd give it a ten," Joe concluded.</p><p id=eUGV-5NeX0C_ data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a aria-label="Prince Charles reveals his favourite cheese recipe - and it looks so delicious" class=hm-link href=#>Prince Charles reveals his favourite cheese recipe - and it looks so delicious</a></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
