From navigating new adventures to life-reshaping experiences, it is looking bright for Sagittarius and Tay Tay.</p><p>There could be a special beginning waiting in the cards.</p><p>Astrologist Susan Miller’s 2024 predictions for Taylor Swift will leave fans optimistic. The <a href=#>celebrity</a> astrology expert <a href=# rel=nofollow>suggests</a> a major shift is in her future. When it comes to <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> and Taylor Swift, a big step in their dreamy relationship is totally possible.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-planets-will-play-a-vital-role-for-the-first-time-in-12-years>The planets will play a vital role ‘for the first time in 12 years’</h3><p>Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are undoubtedly the ‘It couple’ of pop culture right now. Susan predicts the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> has something big coming their way. Jupiter,&nbsp;the planet of good fortune, will be residing in Taylor’s house of marriage ‘for the first time in 12 years,’ making it a grand opportunity for the superstar to finally say I do, according to the zodiac.</p><p>“She’s going to have Gemini (associated with communication and intellect) there, too, the two&nbsp;signs are kind of sharing her house of marriage,’ the astrologist <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> the&nbsp;Daily Mail.</p><p>She added: “Jupiter is only seven degrees [at this time]. It has not made it yet into her house of… marriage and commitment, and it will be there in the spring and all next year, because when Jupiter moves into a Gemini, it’s going to stay there. This could be wonderful, what a beautiful bride she’d be.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1738322026-1024x910.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-could-the-partner-she-was-waiting-for>Travis could the ‘partner’ she was waiting for</h2><p>Travis Kelce is a Libra and Susan believes the <a href=#>Catching Kelce</a> star could be an excellent partner for Taylor Swift.</p><p>“Every Libra I know are so,&nbsp;so good at being married. They’re such good partners,” she offered.</p><p>Sources close to the couple have also re-affirmed Taylor is in a relationship that feels very different from others. The duo may have known each other for only a few months, but they are spending time <a href=#>having deep conversations about their future</a>.</p><p>“They’ve had plenty of really deep conversations about their future together,”&nbsp;an insider <a href=# rel=nofollow>dished out</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-jupiter-effect>The ‘Jupiter’ effect</h3><p>The Jupiter effect for Taylor could also bring an enigmatic career transformation. For the Grammy-winning songstress, it could mean more awards and record-breaking achievements, (a regular for Taylor Alison Swift every year if we are being fair.)</p><p>Along with her career’s epic high tide that is awaiting, as Jupiter will move to the fifth house in April, Taylor may get engaged around this time. It will be an ideal time to pursue the love that is growing deeper.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1801112014-683x1024.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-obstacle>‘The obstacle’</h3><p>Like any other year, 2024 also comes with a fair share of warnings and for T. Swizzle, it is down to her free spirit energy, apparently.</p><p>Susan explained: “Now there’s one little obstacle. Sagittarius is known to be the bachelor sign.</p><p>“It is the one sign that doesn’t like to commit too quickly, if at all. Travel is extremely important to Sagittarius. The older I get, the more I see it in my Sagittarian friends, it’s like oxygen to them. So if Travis likes to travel, that’ll be perfect. Certainly, they’ll have the money.”</p><p>The expert says the compatibility of Taylor and Travis is an added bonus.</p><p>“I also like it that he’s successful and she’s successful,” a match made in stars, we say.</p><p>But with Taylor’s moon being in cancer, Susan claims the hitmaker finally ‘wants a home.’ She says, 2024 will also be a better time for Taylor’s boyfriend. Libra folks had ‘little problem with money, and it wasn’t their fault’ in the past year.</p><p>“The universe must have felt guilty because it’s making a correction. This year (2024), he’s gonna do really well financially. And when a man feels solid financially, they tend to be ready for marriage,” she reassured.</p><p>With a brand-new year beginning and an optimistic horoscope reading, Swifties can’t wait to see what Tay Tay magic they get to experience this year yet again.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2V%2BcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy06xka2hiaXqpu9GoqpynoJp6qbXNrapmpZGnv6qtxp5koqtdnrtuwMeeZJyZopnAbrLOq2StoJVis6q%2B0q1kraGdmnqquoxqaWaxlZa%2FtHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
