Yet, when we choose to adorn our beautiful coils, curls, and braids with abstract colors, we're either subjected to harsh ridicule or left out of the narrative on hair-color experimentation altogether. Either way we're made to feel as if we don't belong.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This type of rhetoric sometimes leaves Black women wanting to stick to the status quo of what's deemed as "acceptable." We stay inside the box to feel safe, to avoid losing our jobs, to feel as though we won't be stereotyped or judged or underestimated, solely based on the texture of our hair and the color we choose to dye it to best express ourselves.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And while understated looks may be a solution for some, let's make one thing clear: Embracing our colorful coils in the way we feel most comfortable — whether blue, pink, yellow, purple, or green — is not a problem.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here, we hear from five Black women who wear their natural hair in living color. And we must say, it's truly a beautiful, and freeing, way to be.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-jennifer-lawrence-25></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Jennifer Lawrence, 25</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Hairstylist living in Ajax, Ontario, Canada</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Phylicia J.

My hair was breaking off from perms, and I was having a lot of scalp irritations from the chemicals. I had been doing this since I was eight or nine, so it's pretty much all I had known. But I was like, 'There has to be another way.' I big chopped it on my own before I went off to hair school, so that was definitely a disaster. Then I came to realize they don't teach you about natural hair in hair school, they only teach you straight hair. After that, I started working in curly hair salons to try and figure out what's going on and where the disconnect is.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once I found out I could color my natural hair and keep it safe and strong, I wanted to do it. I wanted to break the idea that our curls won't look good in color. First of all, who are the people that are saying this and how come it's still being said?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For me, color is one way of expressing myself. As a shy person in new experiences, my hair is an ice-breaker. When I'm out, it will start conversations, people will ask me questions. It's something that will gravitate people to me so I don't always have to gravitate myself to people.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to Black women having colorful hair, I encourage more people to do it. And now at work, I see more Black women leaving this 'safe zone' of reds and browns. I'm happy for that. There are so many more options out there for us.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Lawrence's Go-To Products</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For Wash Day:</strong> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Olaplex No. 0 Intensive Bond Building Hair Treatment</a>, Olaplex No. 3 Hair Perfector, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Olaplex No. 4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Olaplex No. 5 Bond Maintenance Conditioner</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>Olaplex No. 6 Bond Smoother Reparative Styling Creme</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For Styling:</strong> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Kinky Curly Original Curling Custard</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Innersense I Create Lift Volumizing Foam</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Uncle Funky's Daughter Curly Magic Curl Stimulator</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-kierah-hudson-19></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Kierah Hudson, 19</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Student at the University of California, Irvine</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Phylicia J. L. Munn</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I was always straightening my hair and it was really damaged. So when I turned 14, I decided to go natural. I also saw my sister with natural hair doing all these cute hairstyles. I was trying to do them, but my hair wouldn't take to it. So I did a mini <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>big chop</a>, then I transitioned for a year or two and learned how to take care of my hair all over again.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now that I've gone natural, color plays a big role in my beauty aesthetic. I feel like the more vibrant the color, the easier it is to express myself. I even like bright blues and purples and pinks. Right now, my hair is two different colors, honestly because I wanted black hair but I also wanted some color — so I just did half-and-half. I always wanted to try a light, silvery blonde, but I was scared to do my full head, so that's how I ended up with this.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sometimes, my mom and dad will look at me like, "Ugh, you just had to go and do that to your hair, didn't you?" [laughs]. But I'm expressing myself and I think it's cute. It's liberating. We're always told what not to do with our hair, but when we rock what people tell us not to do, it always looks really great. We deserve to have that type of freedom.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the people who say Black women should do otherwise with our hair, I'll say this: Anyone can wear their hair any way they want. Just because you have a darker skin color that does not mean you shouldn't wear bright colors — it actually looks good on us.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Hudson's Go-To Products</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For Wash Day: </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Garnier Honey Treasures Repairing Shampoo</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Aussie 3 Minute Moist Deep Conditioner</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Organic's by Africa's Best Hair Mayonnaise</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For Styling:</strong> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Creme of Nature Argan Oil Buttermilk Leave-In Hair Milk</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>NH DLites Organic Hair Growth Dlites Oil</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Blue Magic Conditioner Hair Dress</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-nubia-bennett-35></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Nubia Bennett, 35</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Diversity and Inclusion Program Coordinator at the University of Louisville</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Phylicia J.

Well, my mom was the first Black yoga instructor in our city. She did belly dancing — all this artsy stuff that is cool for Black women to be into now. So when we were young, she was like, 'No, you can absolutely not get a perm, ever.' So I actually had locs when I was in middle school in the '90s, but I'm in Kentucky — not Atlanta, not Florida, none of that. Kentucky. And everyone would ask me, 'What's wrong with your hair?'</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I ended up taking them down — before it was common knowledge that you could undo locs — around eighth grade and wore my hair natural until I turned 18, then decided to get a perm, because I was 18. I only had it for about four years, it was so much work and expensive. So I started to just grow it out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During the transition, my hair started breaking off. Then once I was around 22 or 23, I just cut the straight parts off, and now I just go between my afro and braids and twists. I can't dye my natural hair because I'm allergic. When I do <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>protective styles</a>, I tend to play with a lot of color, because why not? And the students I work with think it makes me more relatable, ha!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But when it comes to my own personal beauty journey, I love to explore texture and color. It helps me lean into pleasure, because it makes me feel good to be colorful. This is me doing art, even though I am the installation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Every aspect of Black womanhood is policed and managed by other people. But I'm one of the most subversive people I know, and being colorful — it is for other people in a way because it brings other people joy, but it is for me at the end of the day. I'm doing what I want to do, and it feels really, really good to me. That's what I'm led by. And if anybody does want to say anything to me about it being 'unprofessional,' just know I'm qualified. Check these receipts, 'cause I've got these degrees. But I don't care anyway.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Bennette's Go-To Products</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For Wash Day:</strong> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Carol's Daughter Black Vanilla Moisture & Shine Pure Hair Oil</a>, Mo Knows Hair Scalp and Curl Clarifier, Mo Knows Hair Curl Hydrator Shampoo, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Mo Knows Hair Co-Wash & Conditioner</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Mo Knows Curl Restoring Treatment</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For Styling:</strong> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">As I Am Leave In Conditioner</a>, SheaMoisture 100% Pure Jamaican Black Castor Oil, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow">Design Essentials Natural Agave & Lavender Weightless Thermal Protectant Serum</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gabrielle-smith-36></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Gabrielle Smith, 36</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Graphic Designer living in England, U.K.</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Phylicia J.

I originally transitioned in 2006 when I was in university. It was expensive for me to keep getting my hair permed as a student, so I cut my hair off instead. Since then, at first, I was doing mostly braids. Then maybe in 2015, or earlier than that, I locked my hair, and I had locs for six years. Then I decided I was over it, so chopped my hair off and I've kept it low since then.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I'm not somebody who lives by the notion that Black women shouldn't wear bright colors — absolutely not. Plus, I'm a graphic designer, color is something I'm very familiar with in my work and also in my clothes. I'm always wearing bright patterns and colors. My house is decorated with bright patterns and colors. Color is an extension of who I am as a person, it's a part of my identity, as both a Black woman and as a Caribbean woman. So when I see and read comments about Black women, dark-skinned Black women, and how they shouldn't do this or that with color, it's like, 'Why not?' I don't feel like there's any color that's not suitable for Black women. We should be free to wear all of the colors we want.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I like pink in particular, even though it has this kind of 'girly' connotation. I don't see myself as being very girly or very, very feminine, but I feel like pink and different tones of pink are just colors I like. I like how it looks on my skin. I also think it's a color people don't expect Black women to dye their hair. It felt bold, but soft at the same time.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Smith's Go-To Products</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For Wash Day: </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Pantene Gold Series Moisture Boost Shampoo</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Pantene Gold Series Sulfate-Free Moisture Boost Conditioner</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>SheaMoisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate & Repair Intensive Protein Treatment</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For Styling:</strong> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Kinky Curly Knot Today Natural Leave-In Detangler</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Jane Carter Solution Natural Twist-Out Foam</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-angela-barimah-36></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Angela Barimah, 36</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Certified Child Life Specialist living in Brooklyn, NY</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_77-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Phylicia J.

My hair would break in very specific areas — a patch at the crown or at the back, sometimes down to the new growth. I was heartbroken. I also have eczema, and where I would get the eczema flares, that's where the hair would break off.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_80-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When I moved to New York, I started transitioning and was trying to figure out what I was going to do next. I ended up just cutting it off in the shower and I vowed to myself that I would never cut my hair this short ever again, I think that was around 2010. And I've been natural ever since.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_82-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I started this colorful hair journey about a year-ish ago. I always did really fun things with my clothes, but with my hair it was always black and neutral. Since we're not really traveling right now, I needed some inspiration, so I thought, 'What can I do to express myself?' I know it's not through clothes, because where am I going? [laughs] So I needed to figure out how I could still express myself in a fun, creative way. That's how I ended up here.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_84-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It was a lightbulb moment for me with my hair. I had to realize, like yeah, you can do that with your hair. No, you won't look crazy. Yes, there are intentional reasons why people tell Black women we can't wear certain colors. So I figured I'd just try it, then I fell in love with it. I think when we look back on our time in terms of the big beauty trends — however many years from now — I believe we'll remember hair color, and Black women being able to express themselves in all forms, which is so beautiful.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_86-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Barimah's Go-To Products</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_87-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For Wash Day:</strong> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Maui Moisture Thicken & Restore + Bamboo Fibers Strengthening Shampoo</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Maui Moisture Thicken & Restore + Bamboo Fibers Strengthening Conditioner</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_89-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For Styling: </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Mystic Essence Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Pomade</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_91-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Interviews have edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_93-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Each product we feature has been independently selected and reviewed by our editorial team.
