That is why you need to know the right things to comment on your friend's posts to excite them up.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/96b45d2096155028.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Do you have friends who never like your posts? Here's why</span></p></a><h2>Good things to comment on your friend’s post</h2><p class=align-left>While other people may be writing general comments about your friend's post, show off that you know more about them by going the extra mile with your comment. It could be a comment about a place you went together, a childhood memory or something they like. Some of the nice things you can comment on your friend’s post include:</p><ul><li>I can’t bother to look up the meaning of the word stunning in the dictionary because I know your selfie is placed right next to it.</li><li>Someone better call 911 because my friend’s post is hot.</li><li>Did you snap all this by yourself? We need to hook up so you can show me your ways.</li><li>You must be an authentic influencer because all I ever want is to follow whatever you do.</li><li>We should have this much fun every time we hang out together. I miss you.</li><li>My friend is shining brighter than the sun.</li><li>I don't know why I am smiling, but it is probably because you are the one person who always makes me laugh.</li><li>Why does this post not have a million more likes?</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a32fe3edefacb293.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>130+ best flirty comments for your crush's pics on Instagram</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/96b45d2096155028.jpg><ul><li>I am yet to see another person whose heart is as pure and beautiful as their face.</li><li>If I had a time machine, I'd take both of us back in time to this day.</li><li>This shot makes me even more excited and anxious for the next adventure we do together.</li><li>Thank you for what you are and what I am whenever I am with you.</li><li>You never get tired of blessing my feed!

When it comes to Instagram, any user will get discouraged if all posts do not react to followers. It is those who get likes that are encouraged to post more for even more likes. To successfully hype someone on <a href=#>Instagram</a>, you should use comments like:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a91f9eb679982aa3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ sweet quotes about liking a boy straight from your heart</span></p></a><ul><li>Excuse me, my queen, I think this belongs to you (crown emoji).</li><li>Just another extraordinary picture of an extraordinary person to go into my extraordinary collection.</li><li>You need to start sharing some beauty tips with the rest of us.</li><li>Your beauty has no boundaries.</li><li>The only person I know whose hot girl summer lasts all year round.</li><li>I don’t care if I am always second best as long as my best friend remains the number one beauty queen in the world.</li><li>Bestfriend time will always be my best time.</li><li>We will forever stick together and continue to slay together.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a32fe3edefacb293.jpg><ul><li>This is the best picture I have seen all week.</li><li>We may not be sisters by blood, but we will always be sisters by heart.</li><li>I am so happy that you are doing this great.

They help us keep in touch and know what our friends have been up to in our absence. The best Instagram comments for friends must give prominence to their beauty and their achievements. Take the chance to show them how much you appreciate them with comments like:</p><ul><li>I am yet to see your selfie that I did not like.</li><li>Your beauty can’t be rivalled, just as stunning as ever.</li><li>You are so unreal. I am honoured to call you my friend.</li><li>I have to contact NASA and let them know that I have discovered a new star.</li><li>The sun must be feeling jealous this morning because you are hotter.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6201ac82e4b8ff16.jpg><ul><li>If they hate us, it is because they aren't us.</li><li>I only roll with goddesses, and you are the greatest of them all.</li><li>Master, teach me your ways of taking selfies so that I can become like you.</li><li>I don’t know any other better definition of fun other than you.</li><li>As always, the view is fantastic but not as unique as you look.</li><li>How do you manage to keep this fit even without going to the gym?</li><li>This selfie will bring many girlfriends into your world.</li><li>Your makeup looks impressive.

However, even as you try to show your funny side, be cautious not to overstep and write <a href=#>jokes</a> that will end up being offensive rather than cheering.</p><p class=align-left>Do not disguise insults as jokes because they will only anger your friend and end up sabotaging your relationship. Some of the funny hype comments you can post include:</p><ul><li>I was about to note that there is no competition for your gorgeous looks, but that was before I looked in the mirror.</li><li>Damn, your smile is so dangerous.</li><li>You are the second most beautiful thing in the world, after me of course.</li><li>I lied when I said there is nothing I can't do without you because I had to use every trick to honour seeing pictures like this.</li><li>I believe I am speaking on behalf of the entire world when I say thank you for blessing us with this selfie.</li><li>Too much sweetness in this photo. If I get diabetes, know that you are the one responsible.</li><li>Looking for a hacker to take this photo down. I can't stand competition from someone so hot.</li><li>I swear you were my other half and human diary the other second. I don't know how you managed to become Miss World in such a short time.</li><li>I encourage you to continue hanging out with me more because my cuteness is rubbing off on you.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c3ddac02bc1dadd6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>150+ funny comments on friends pic on Instagram to crack them up</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a91f9eb679982aa3.jpg><ul><li>Stunning, but don't forget that you will be an old lady who will be causing trouble in a nursing home one day.</li><li>I have always thought that standing by your side makes you look better. Care to explain why I wasn't invited for this snap then?</li><li>I know you have always hated my honesty when I share nasty sentiments about you, but that won't stop me from saying this if you were put in a list of 10 <a href=#>models</a>. I had to rank according to beauty; I would eliminate you from the list because you are too superior to be put on any list.</li><li>If you don't include me in all your photos henceforth, when I die, I will come back as a ghost to haunt you.</li><li>They say that for every two friends, one must be pretty and the other one ugly. All I am saying is that I am not the ugly one, so we may never know!</li><li>I know we agreed not to worry about not being socially acceptable, but it was not meant to be a ticket for you always to stand out.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f41cb98f622473ce.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>120+ deep love messages for him to make him feel adored</span></p></a><p class=align-left>There is no shortage of nice things to comment on your friend's post to hype them up.
