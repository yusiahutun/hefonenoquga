Bella is a very nice person but struggles with the pressures of fame. She has been trying to take care of herself since their split.</p><p>‚ÄúBella is taking some much-deserved time off to treat her Lyme disease.

The model is currently taking time out to focus on her <a href=#>health</a>.</p><p>Just a few months ago, the star opened up about a recent flare-up over on her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TikTok</a>, due to a tooth infection. In the caption, she wrote:</p><p>‚ÄúPlease listen to your bodies my friends please!!! This made my Lyme flare up, which means the Lyme is attacking the places that are suffering ie tooth, jaw, gut, brain, spine, bones etc oh, and the entire nervous system.‚Äù</p><p>Her brother Anwar, and mom Yolanda, have also been diagnosed with the illness.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@babybella777 href=#>@babybella777</a><p>Tooth update! There was a low-grade infection underneath the tooth, NEXT to the tooth I thought was suffering(she‚Äôs good) which is the one I got a root canal on a year ago. It continued to spread down,causing a low grade infection in my jaw. I have felt in my heart for months that I needed this tooth out, to heal the rest, and if not, it was going to take me out!Please listen to your bodies my friends please!!! This made my Lyme flare up, which means the Lyme is attacking the places that are suffering ie tooth, jaw, gut, brain, spine, bones, etc oh and the entire nervous systemüíï Any minor trauma to the body whether it‚Äôs physically or mentally can cause Lyme to flare up. My jaw has been so inflamed, and would flare up/inflame randomly when I was/am overly stressed or over working. Lyme flare ups happen all the time, so that doesn‚Äôt worry me, it‚Äôs more-so the jaw situation and how radiating the pain is especially with the Lyme. Some days okay! and some days are difficult. but when my jaw/nerves started to hurt on an aggressive level; it just went 0-100. And now we‚Äôre here! I am ok though!! i feel better when I‚Äôm riding! (And after starting the 2 rounds of anti-biotics) (that in itself is a wild ride) I think my horses just really take my mind off the pain. This is the reason i stopped riding 10 years ago, and i wasn‚Äôt going to let it get to me at my first show backü§≠anyways , moral of the story , I‚Äôm getting this tooth extracted tomorrow! Going to heal that infection! Ive never been so excited go to the dentist..thank you for checking in on me I see you all!! wish me luck!!!</p><a title="‚ô¨ PRETTY BOY FLOW - STURDYYOUNGIN" href=#>‚ô¨ PRETTY BOY FLOW ‚Äì STURDYYOUNGIN</a></figure><p>View TikTok</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bella-hadid-marc-kalman-s-relationship-timeline>Bella Hadid Marc Kalman‚Äôs relationship timeline</h2><p>The couple were very private about their relationship, however, it is said they began dating in the Summer of 2020, after being spotted out together in New York.</p><p>Bella, sister to <a href=#>Gigi Hadid</a>, seemingly confirmed the relationship a year later.
