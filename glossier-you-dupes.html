When it was released in 2017, it quickly became everyone’s signature scent, and it was even voted Fragrance of the Year in 2018. <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Glossier You</a> is described as warm and spicy, with notes of pink pepper, iris, and amber. While other perfumes dominate your natural scent, Glossier You enhances it. And even though the perfume smells different on everyone, TikTokers have found Glossier You dupes that they swear smell just like the real thing.</p><p>What makes <a href=#>Glossier You</a> so special? It’s made with more base notes—and fewer top notes—than other perfumes. So it complements the way you smell, rather than covering it up. <a rel=nofollow href=#>TikTokers describe Glossier You</a> as “the essence of clean and sexy musk,” and they say it lives up to its promise. The fragrance notes really do blend with the oils in your skin to make the perfume smell different on you than it does on anyone else. While Glossier You has easily recognizable scent, its fragrance notes smell differently depending on the wearer. “You are the last ingredient,” Glossier emphasizes—and honestly, the brand is right.</p><p>When something becomes as popular as Glossier You, it’s only natural to look for alternatives. Glossier You is expensive. (A 50-milliliter bottle costs $72, and a 100-milliliter bottle costs $104.) And that’s a lot to spend on perfume—no matter how good it smells.</p><p>Amidst the Glossier You dupe craze, <a rel=nofollow href=#>one TikToker claimed</a> to have found a men’s body wash that smells identical to You. As a result, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Harry’s Fig Body Wash</a> became an overnight sensation—with TikTok users running to their nearest Target to get their hands on it.&nbsp;And that’s not the only Glossier You dupe you can find. Super-fans may argue there’s nothing like the original, but the internet is full of budget-friendly Glossier You alternatives that supposedly smell just like the real thing.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Glossier You Eau de Parfum&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/glossier.png><p>Glossier You Eau de Parfum</p><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Glossier You</a> is the control of our science experiment.
