The 34-year-old is continuing her <a href=#>Eras Tour</a>, and her latest leg is in Australia, after she completed a spell in Tokyo, Japan, earlier this month.</p><p>Luckily, she was about to fly back on her private jet to make it in time for the Super Bowl to support her beau. She must have been a Good Luck charm, because the Kansas City Chiefs won it again for the fourth time. The songwriter then rushed to the field to <a href=#>embrace and kiss Travis in celebration</a>.</p><p>Now a body language expert has analyzed the cute photo and videos of the pair. He says the Lover hitmaker has a ‘subtle power move’ that means she ‘wears the trousers’.</p><p>Darren Stanton, dubbed the ‘Human Lie Detector’, told us although they’re obviously affectionate and enjoying their time together, Travis is finding the media circus difficult.</p><p>He told CelebrityTidbit on behalf of <a href=# rel=nofollow>SpinGenie</a>: “Taylor definitely wears the trousers and this is clear when she puts her hand on Travis’ back whilst they are walking. This is what you call a ‘power pat’ and shows that she is the more dominant one in the relationship.</p><p>“He looks like a fish out of water and as though he wants to get back to the States where he feels comfortable. In one photograph, he’s looking down at the ground, shuffling about and playing with his hat. He’s trying to convey he’s fine but these are what we call pacifying and self-reassuring gestures.”</p><p>Whilst Darren insists the couple’s affection towards one appears genuine, he also notes Travis looks uncomfortable and distracted on the date. He believes the sports star is growing tired of the mania surrounding their relationship.</p><p>Darren, who served as a police officer and has a degree in psychology, added: “He’s usually quite an animated character so this departure from his usual demeanour probably signifies he feels uncomfortable and perhaps growing tired of feeling like he’s on display.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-power-struggle-looms-for-taylor-and-travis>‘Power struggle’ looms for Taylor and Travis</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1747950252-833x1024.jpg><p>It comes after relationship experts have warned <a href=#>Taylor and Travis may come across a ‘power struggle’</a> in their early days of their relationship.</p><p>Orna and Matthew Walters told CelebrityTidbit this week the Hollywood stars may face hardship ahead once they outlive the ‘Honeymoon Phase’.</p><p>The dating gurus, who have appeared on Bravo’s The Millionaire Matchmaker, of <a href=# rel=nofollow>LoveOnPurpose</a> said: “Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are clearly in the Romance Stage, and fun to watch and oooh and aaaah over. Their relationship is under a microscope through extraordinary circumstances professionally and personally. They have yet to experience the mundane day-to-day of sharing their lives.</p><p>“Eventually, those feel-good chemicals wear off and you’ll find yourself in the second stage of relationship: The Power Struggle. No couple skips the power struggle stage which is not about overcoming one disagreement: it’s a fight cycle.”</p><p>Thankfully, it’s not dire news. Simply, they have to learn how to deal with conflict when it first arises in a new relationship. The experts said Taylor and Travis will need to learn how to work through differences for “lasting love”.</p><p>We think they’ve got it in the bag.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2d%2FcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy06xkrK2SqbmmecGuq2acn6K2r63NrWSgnaOpwrOxjLCgraBdqruku8yfpquskZe5pnnTq5ivoaNiuKa4wp5kmqxdqMalusSyZLOnn2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
