Focus on Tools</strong></p><p>When choosing a manicure kit, focus on multifunctional tools made from stainless steel, carbon steel, or nickel-plated steel to prevent corrosion. Basic tools like nail clippers, cuticle clippers, files, cuticle removers or trimmers, scissors, and tweezers are a must-have. Apart from that, look for nail buffers made with fine-grade sandpaper for smoother nails.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Type of Manicure</strong></p><p>Your manicure kit should match what you need. For natural nails, get a basic kit with a metal file. If your nails break often or have issues like hangnails or ingrown nails, the Tweezerman Mini Nail Rescue Kit must help. For luxurious pampering needs, something like the Beurer 14-piece professional grooming kit with a nail drill could be a better choice.</p><p><strong>3. Type of Case</strong></p><p>Manicure kits often come in PSU leather cases, which are both safe and secure. These cases keep your tools in place, preventing them from slipping out. If you fancy a classy case that looks great even on display, consider the MR.GREEN manicure set. But if you need a kit for your travels, the portable Revlon manicure set is a good option. Plus, a case with a 'How To Use' guide is a bonus – it ensures you know how to make the most of your tools.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Safety Features</strong></p><p>When picking a manicure set, look for tools with non-slip handles, rounded edges, and safety caps. Stainless steel and fine steel are great choices as they don't rust and reduce the risk of infections. Use curved clippers for fingernails and straight ones for toenails. Also, be cautious with callus removal tools; avoid sharp ones to stay safe and injury-free.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>6. Add a Curing Lamp</strong></p><p>You can also add a curing lamp to your cart to level up your manicure game. These fancy gadgets, often used by nail technicians aid in drying and setting acrylic or gel nails as well as gel polish. They're like mini tabletop units you find in salons but are now available online for your DIY nail sessions. With UV exposure, they make sure your nails look flawless and last longer.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>7. Nail Color Options</strong></p><p>When choosing a manicure set, don't forget to look at the nail polish options. Some sets offer just a couple of colors, while others give you a whole collection. Pick shades you'll actually wear to get the most out of your money. Your regular nail polish not only makes the nails look great but can also boost your confidence and mood.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=title>Steps to Do Manicure at Home</h2></p><p>Now that you know how to select the ideal manicure kit, the next step is learning how to use the tools correctly.
