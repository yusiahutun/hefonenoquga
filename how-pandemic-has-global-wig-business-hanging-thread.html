“When the borders were closed in January last year, my vendors [in China] were telling me to stock as much as you can right now,” Smith-Serrano said.
“They said at that time that March could be better, and then maybe by August things might be back to normal, and that was in 2020 and we are still at the same position as the cost is going up."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Most of North Korea’s international trade has been banned under <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">United Nations sanctions</span></a> since 2016 as part of the punishment for its nuclear tests.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The bulk of the trade that it does do – roughly 90 per cent – is with China, and one of the thriving categories has been in hair and wigs, which are not banned under the sanctions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China is the world’s largest wig export, accounting for 70 per cent of the global supply, but it relies heavily on labour in North Korea, where Chinese factories have long outsourced production to reduce costs, industry insiders say.</p>“Usually Chinese companies import human hair from India or Myanmar and send them, together with the lace, both domestic and foreign made, over to North Korea, where the labour cost is much lower,” a manager in the central Chinese city of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Xuchang, China’s wig capital,</span></a> said.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In wig processing factories in North Korea, well-trained workers, paid only half – or even less – that of their Chinese counterparts, skilfully knot each strand of hair into the wig cap by hand, making a premium wig that gives a more natural look and fit.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These semi-finished wigs are then sent back to China, where they are further processed and packed before being shipped to the rest of the world, particularly the US, which accounts for over 40 per cent of global demand.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“One of the biggest sellers in the hair industry are wigs as that goes for just people who like to use them, but also especially in the States for not just cosmetic purposes, but practical purposes to cancer patients,” Smith-Serrano said.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2019/03/20/8106072_hd-50i_4503.mp4_.00_00_12_08.still001_1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:21</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Xuchang city: China’s wig capital</p><p>Xuchang city: China’s wig capital</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Before the pandemic, Chinese companies would send tonnes of human hair to North Korea each month, according to Chinese data. In January last year when the coronavirus outbreak started, 14 million yuan (US$2.17 million) worth of “human hair, wool and other textile prepared for use in making wigs” was shipped to North Korea but a month later, that total had dropped to 452,000 yuan. Since then no trade in human hair between the two countries has been recorded.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chinese companies have looked for alternatives, such as employing local workers to fill the gap, but Smith-Serrano said prices continued to keep going up “almost every week”. The knotting on the North Korean product also appeared to be better too, she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A Chinese wig vendor in Shandong province confirmed the cost increase, saying a wig hand-knotted by Chinese workers was 30 per cent more expensive “but the quality is not that good”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Chinese magazine People, the wig industry in China was so desperate for skilled workers that they launched a national campaign – all to no avail.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Knotting is like sowing seeds, it depends not only on the spacing of the rows but there are various techniques such as single layer and progressive stitching, which cannot be learned in a short time,” the report said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Then there is added cost of the disruptions to imports of natural hair, mostly from India and Myanmar, which have been largely suspended since last year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Human hair has become such a coveted commodity in China that in March, police in the southwestern province of Yunnan said they arrested 11 cross-border gangs and arrested 48 people for smuggling 1.1 billion yuan worth of human hair from India, Pakistan and Myanmar. According to police, human hair that once sold for 220 yuan each kilogram could now fetch more than four times that amount in China.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2019/12/30/clean_realistic_wig_scmpnext_thumbnail.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:08</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">‘Realistic’ wigs for people who need hair help go viral online in China</p><p>‘Realistic’ wigs for people who need hair help go viral online in China</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Smith-Serrano said the supply-chain disruptions were taking a heavy toll on small businesses like hers that were less able to absorb the higher costs or pass them along to customers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since the pandemic, shipping times have lengthened and her revenue is down by about 20 per cent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s very bad, especially when you’re just so dependent on China, that’s kind of just how this business is run, no matter if you have your own little factory or conglomerate-type situation, you’re just so dependent on it. And it’s when the source dries up, it dries up,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her biggest concern, however, is that if the China-North Korea border restrictions are prolonged, her store, now running out of stock for the premium lace wig and hair extensions, will eventually lose her edge.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I did look into maybe circumventing China, going to India or Brazil or the Philippines. However, the level of technology, the latest technology in hair extensions which we have been known for, they just didn’t have it,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Additional reporting by Xiaoxiao Yang</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Global wig trade hangs by a hair during pandemic</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyltc%2BlpqaZk658or7TopqlnV9ofnSAlGxuaKCfrHqxrc2dnKahk2K1or%2BMoKOompGheri1xmaZrquZo7K0v4yhmKefmaO0bsDHq5yanA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
