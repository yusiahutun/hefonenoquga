As <strong>Dave Holmes’</strong>&nbsp;profile for <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Esquire</a> notes, he was a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>struggling actor in his twenties and thirties</a> before this new level of fame. He had his short arc in Game of Thrones, which included a mind-blowingly death. He appeared on Netflix’s early show, Narcos, but it wasn’t until he donned The Mandalorian helm that his star really rose. His <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>role as Joel</a> in The Last of Us, the HBO adaptation of the hit video game, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cemented</a> his place as a star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Pedro-Pascal-Met-Gala-2023-embed-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Pedro-Pascal-Met-Gala-2023-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I died so many deaths,” he said in the Esquire piece. “My vision of it was that if I didn’t have some major exposure by the time I was twenty-nine years old, it was over, so I was constantly readjusting what it meant to commit my life to this profession, and giving up the idea of it looking like I thought it would when I was a kid. There were so many good reasons to let that delusion go.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“He’s talked about this publicly,” says <strong>Sarah Paulson</strong>, Pedro’s close friend (who appeared alongside him in a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Saturday Night Live sketch</a> about their “daddy”/”mommy” appeal”), “but there were times when I would give him my per diem from a job I was working on so that he could have money to feed himself.” His persistence in his career ultimately paid off, with him reaching his breakthrough at a time when Hollywood would generally say it was time for the curtain to fall.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“I had a moment of thinking, You’re in your forties, and you don’t own a home? Grow up. But I’m relinquishing expectations around what it is to be middle-aged and what it means to be fully grown up,” Pedro also told Dave Holmes. “Why am I trying to force a square shape into a triangle?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Pedro will appear in Strange Way of Life, portraying a rancher who visits an old friend, a sheriff played by <strong>Ethan Hawke</strong>. “The strange way of life referred in the title alludes to the famous fado [mournful Portuguese song] by Amalia Rodrigues, whose lyrics suggest that there is no stranger existence than the one that is lived by turning your back on your own desires,” said director <strong>Pedro Almodóvar</strong> in press materials for the film, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Polygon</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH12e49qZqmdlKe8brzArJqapF2isrV5xpqjmmViZX90ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
