Not long after, I began experiencing immense stress due to the pandemic and social and political events through the end of the year.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=2></span> And between 2021 and early 2023, I was navigating an infuriatingly long process of getting my daughter an autism diagnosis and treatment, so the stress — and the hair shedding — worsened.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Editor's Note</h3><p>Always speak with a healthcare professional before adding any supplement to your routine to ensure that it is appropriate for your individual needs and confirm that there are no contraindications with any prescription medications you are taking.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While hair loss in people assigned male at birth is a well-known concern, hair loss in people assigned female at birth is discussed far less.

Since it can take up to six months to see noticeable hair growth, I wanted to see what difference, if any, the Nutrafol supplement made at the halfway point (three months).

In its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>letter to the FDA and FTC</a>, Truth in Advertising argued that this claim is misleading because the four trials cited were paid for and performed by Nutrafol and the results were limited.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, several customer reviews on the brand's website claim the product is effective at reducing shedding, stimulating new hair growth, and improving thickness and volume.

It took under three minutes and assessed me in all six areas that the supplements are supposed to address (hormones, stress, lifestyle, metabolism, nutrition, and aging) — then it made the recommendation, which was the product I’d expected. I wasn’t pushed to purchase any of the recommended products after taking the quiz; I still had the option to just choose the formula that I thought was best for me (which was the same one that the quiz recommended).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For this article, InStyle reimbursed me for the cost of the Nutrafol subscription. Even though the subscription is pricey, if I continue to see hair growth I would pay out of my own pocket to continue taking the supplement once the six-month testing period has ended.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to spending money, I don’t mind investing in products that work or will last — like a really <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>good pair of jeans</a> or a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>high-end hairdryer</a> — but otherwise, I tend to have a “the cheaper, the better” attitude. I appreciated that in addition to a discount when you sign up for an auto-fill plan, Nutrafol also offers free consultations with a naturopathic doctor (a perk I haven’t taken advantage of yet). You can also pause or cancel the subscription at any time after sign-up.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nutrafol does give you the option of purchasing add-ons with your supplement subscription. However, I have not tried any of the add-ons; I wanted to see if the standard supplement alone would be enough to help my situation because I would obviously rather not spend more money than I have to.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Truth be told, I think the add-ons are intriguing, but I doubt I’d go the extra step in trying one unless I knew for certain there was a legitimate need, such as a blood test showing high levels of cortisol. I don’t like putting loads of supplements into my body — no matter how “natural” the ingredients — so I’d probably consult with a dermatologist before I’d add another supplement to the mix.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-my-experience-using-the-nutrafol-womens-hair-growth-supplement></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>My Experience Using the Nutrafol Women's Hair Growth Supplement</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">My three-month Nutrafol supply was delivered six days after I placed my order.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I received one month’s worth of pills in a glass jar, which was packaged in a small cardboard box, as well as two refill packs in thick, sealed plastic bags. All three products were tightly packed in a compact shipping box and there didn’t appear to be any damage. The subsequent months came in pouches that I was able to pour into the jar once I had finished the prior month’s supply. I was a little disappointed because even though the refill pouches are made from “previously recycled plastic” they are not recyclable; as Nutrafol says on its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">FAQ page</a>, “most plastic cannot be recycled twice.”&nbsp;<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Ashley Ziegler</p></span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Taking the Pills</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Upon opening the jar with my first month’s supply, I was a bit shocked by how large the pills were — each is around three-quarters of an inch long (about the size of a quarter).</p><p>I hate taking big pills, and I was not looking forward to taking four of these very large pills every day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I didn’t see anything on the label that said it was okay to split the dosing up, such as two pills in the morning and then the other two in the afternoon, so I just accepted that I’d have to hype myself up each day (this is, of course, a me-problem, but also a good FYI to anyone else who hates taking pills like I do).&nbsp;<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Ashley Ziegler</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I was pleasantly surprised to find that the supplements didn’t have a strong odor. A lot of natural supplements have a distinct smell, so I braced myself for Nutrafol to be the same. It was nice opening up the container each day without that typical musty odor wafting out (gross).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>Aside from the size of the pills, the most difficult thing for me was getting into the habit of taking Nutrafol every day.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I take multivitamins and ADHD medications in the morning, so I didn’t want to add Nutrafol in the mix and risk feeling very, very nauseous. So I decided to take the supplements around lunchtime. Unfortunately, I just don’t have a very good daily lunchtime routine, so I’d randomly remember around 3 p.m. and have to find a snack to take them with since they need to be taken with food. As long as I had food in my stomach when taking them, though, I didn’t feel any negative side effects from the supplements (if I took them on an empty stomach, I would feel queasy).</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_77-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>When I Started to See Results</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After about a month I noticed I was shedding less hair, and about six weeks in, my hair stylist told me she was noticing tiny new hairs popping up, a sign of new growth.&nbsp;</p><p>I also noticed less breakage — which had been a real problem for me.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I was honestly in a bit of disbelief that this was the result of Nutrafol. I kept trying to find other explanations, because after all of the money I’d poured into hair growth products over the last two years, it was really hard for me trust that something was actually working.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ashley Ziegler</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_84-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By the end of my third month, I could visibly see new growth along my hairline, and my hair stylist showed me how many tiny hairs were sticking out all around my head in areas I wouldn’t have thought to look for otherwise. She told me that new growth is particularly easy to spot after using a hair dryer because it sticks straight out and doesn’t like to lie flat.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_86-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I could definitely spot the new hair once I knew what to look for. While I wish there had been more of a difference, I do think my hairline looks a little fuller than it did before I started Nutrafol.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-fast-facts-about-nutrafol></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_88-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Fast Facts About Nutrafol</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_89-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Customer Service</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_90-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nutrafol’s customer service left a lot to be desired. There is a chatbot on the website that can help with basic questions anytime. It can connect you to a service agent, but only if you initiate the chat between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. ET Monday through Friday, which isn’t exactly ideal for people who live in this time zone and work traditional business hours. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">contact page</a> does have an option to email customer service, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Finding a phone number to actually call and speak to someone took me a bit of investigative work</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_93-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It’s not listed on the “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">Contact Us</a>” page so I ended up finding the number through Nutrafol’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Facebook page</a>. Once I got through the phone line, it was pretty easy (I didn’t have to sit through countless menus to speak to someone) and the representative was very kind and helpful when I asked for account details. Still, it’s disappointing that the number isn’t easier to find and that the chat feature’s hours are so limited.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_95-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Cancelling An Auto-Fill Subscription</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_96-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After my initial three-month package was delivered, I went into the system to see how to cancel my membership — not because I anticipated the pills wouldn’t work or because I wanted to cancel just yet, but because if they didn’t work I knew I’d forget to cancel the subscription otherwise (I’ve fallen victim to the auto-renew model more times than I care to admit). I was happy to see that it was really easy to stop. I didn’t have to jump through a bunch of hoops or answer several pop-up questions.

If for some reason you decide the supplements aren’t for you, you can return them for a refund within 30 days of delivery, which is really helpful if you purchase multiple months upfront and don’t want to lose all of the money you invested.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_101-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Company Reputation</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_102-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Thousands of customers, including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>some celebrities</a>, have praised Nutrafol’s products, but the brand is not without a little bad press. In April 2023, the nonprofit organization Truth in Advertising <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>filed a complaint</a> with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) claiming the company uses deceptive marketing by calling its products “clinically proven.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_104-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The reason Truth in Advertising was able to take action is that Nutrafol is considered a dietary supplement, which does not require FDA approval; however, FDA approval is needed in order to make certain health claims.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=6></span> So, while what Nutrafol claims its product can do may be true, there are legalities around the language the company can use in its marketing as a dietary supplement without FDA approval.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pros-and-cons></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_106-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pros and Cons</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_107-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After using Nutrafol for three months (halfway through my testing experience) here are my pros and cons for the service<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>Actually seems to be working for me</li><li>Easy sign-up and cancellation</li><li>Option to purchase a single month without commitment&nbsp;</li><li>Relatively quick shipping (approximately six days)</li><li>Quiz delivers personalized formula recommendation</li><li>Free consultations with a naturopathic doctor with an auto-fill subscription</li><li>More customized treatment with optional add-ons</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>Pills are very big</li><li>Large daily dose (four pills)</li><li>Has to be taken with a meal</li><li>More expensive than a lot of other OTC treatments</li><li>Have to pay multiple months upfront in order to get discounts</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-my-final-thoughts></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_110-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>My Final Thoughts</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_111-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since all of the information on Nutrafol’s site indicated that it would take <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">three to six months</a> to see results, I assumed that if I did see any change, it would be minimal. Plus, after trying so many other products in the years and months leading up to testing Nutrafol’s supplements, my expectations were very low.</p><p>To actually see visible progress at the midway point of testing is really exciting.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_114-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, I can’t ignore how many pills are required in order to see results. To me, four large pills per day is a lot for an OTC treatment (also, I’ve determined that it’s impossible to find a compact way to pack seven days' worth of these pills plus all of my other daily medications into a travel bag for vacation).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_116-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I also don’t know how sustainable the price tag is. Not to mention, assuming the supplement is a total success, what happens if I stop taking it?&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_118-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even with my reservations and long-term questions, at the end of three months, I can confidently say that I’d feel comfortable recommending Nutrafol to someone who was looking for an over-the-counter way to address hair shedding or loss. My only caveat is that, given its price point, I would be mindful and upfront about the cost when giving the recommendation. And, honestly, if I’m feeling this assured about the product at the mid-way point in the trial, I can hardly wait to see the regrowth progress at the six-month mark.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_120-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nutrafol also offers a hair growth supplement designed for people assigned female at birth over 45+ (We are currently testing this, but customer reviews on the brand website are positive.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yGarq6GVmXqvwdOrmJ%2BnnGK%2FpsLInq5mb2VrhnSBkg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
