What people love most about this body wash is how well it lathers. “Native Coconut & Vanilla has become my new favorite soap. I started with the smaller size and immediately purchased the largest size when I ran out,” wrote one shopper. “The soap lathers easily on the towel and the skin without feeling heavy. Also, the smell is calming, refreshing, and long-lasting. I can’t wait to try the other Native products.”</p><p>Geeta Yadav, MD, board-certified dermatologist and founder of <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>FACET</a> dermatology&nbsp;is a fan of Native. “I like how many fragrances you can choose from,” says Dr. Yadav. “And you can also pick unscented. The formula lathers nicely without stripping skin as its surfactants are derived from coconut oil.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-25-at-9.50.08-AM.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=naturium-the-perfector-salicylic-acid-skin-smoothing-body-wash>Naturium The Perfector Salicylic Acid Skin Smoothing Body Wash</h2><p>Since this body wash is packed with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">salicylic acid,</a> it gently exfoliates without over drying the skin. It’s perfect for anyone who has body acne or anyone who sweats a lot during the day and wants to be gently exfoliating each day. “I love this! I have acne and have had it forever,” wrote one reviewer. “Usually before my cycle it springs up in my face and this has helped my acne so much! I have smooth skin and no scent! I just love it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-25-at-12.12.41-PM.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=dove-deep-moisture-nourishes-the-driest-skin-body-wash>Dove Deep Moisture Nourishes the Driest Skin Body Wash</h2><p>“I like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dove</a> formulas because they offer moisturizing benefits that can last for up to 24 hours,” says Dr. Yadav. “They work by supporting the ceramides in your skin, which help prevent transepidermal water loss.”</p><p>And at just $6.99 per bottle, this price is hard to beat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-12-at-10.42.17-AM.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=saltair-seascape-body-wash>Saltair Seascape Body Wash</h2><p>If you put “SALTAIR” into the <a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok</a> search bar, you’ll find hundreds of videos of satisfied customers who are raving about their new favorite brand. After trying this out myself, I can see why. The Saltair <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">body washes</a> (and deodorants!) smell so good, have the coolest metal recyclable packaging and at under $12, is super affordable to boot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-25-at-12.15.25-PM.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=aveeno-fragrance-free-active-naturals-skin-relief-body-wash>Aveeno Fragrance Free Active Naturals Skin Relief Body Wash</h2><p>“I’m a big fan of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Aveeno</a> products because of their oat extracts,” says Dr. Yadav. “Oat is a natural humectant emollient — the extracts in this formula help draw water to the skin and seal it in, leaving skin moisturized and comfortable. This one is unscented and is ideal for those with easily irritated skin, like people with eczema.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screen-Shot-2023-02-07-at-10.44.42-AM.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=harry-s-fig-body-wash>Harry’s Fig Body Wash</h2><p>If you’re a fan of Le Labo’s Rose 31 scent, you need this <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Target dupe</a> in your bathroom. The reason this stuff smells so great is the notes of of fig, cardamom and blood orange that are found in each bottle. Plus, each formula is made without parabens, sulfates or dyes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-04-04-at-12.49.26-PM.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=blueland-body-wash-starter-set>Blueland Body Wash Starter Set</h2><p>If you’re conscious of your product waste and are looking for a way to cut down on plastic, Blueland is the brand for you. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TikTok</a> can’t get enough of this <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">product launch</a> and you can buy refill pods for just $9.79 after you go through a bottle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-17-at-12.00.05-PM.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=no-03-moroccan-mint-cedar-body-wash>No.03 Moroccan Mint & Cedar Body Wash</h2><p>What I love about the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Goodfellow</a> products is how aesthetically pleasing they look on your counter top or tub-side, while packing a powerful scent and being super-affordable at the same time. One reviewer wrote, it “smells amazing and feels good on skin,” adding that “it lathers pretty well and it’s become my favorite body wash. I guess this body wash was meant to be for men but I use it for myself.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-18-at-6.54.13-AM.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=beloved-lavender-and-chamomile-tea-vegan-body-wash>Beloved Lavender and Chamomile Tea Vegan Body Wash</h2><p>You’re probably already a fan of the cult-favorite brand Love & Beauty Planet, but have you tried their Target-exclusive line, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Beloved</a>? This eco-conscious little sister brand is making waves at the retailer by being made with 92 percent of naturally-derived, consciously-sourced essential oils, making it ultra-gentle on skin. Plus it’s vegan, sulfate- and paraben-free and packed in bottles that are made from 100 percent recycled plastic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1mmpqqlWR%2BdIWSamxrZ5KawLV505qpoJ2kYq%2BwsNhmrpqrmGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
