Depp won the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>defamation trial</a>&nbsp;on June 1, 2022, after he sued Heard for $50 million. The trial was held due to an op-ed Heard wrote in The Washington Post in 2018 about her experiences with domestic abuse. Like Depps’s songs, no names were mentioned in the op-ed. However, many people speculated the article to be about her marriage to Depp. Depp claimed that the op-ed cost him his acting jobs.</p><p>Recently, Heard and her lawyers tried to o make a case for a <a href=# rel=noopener>mistrial</a>&nbsp;due to a juror mishap. According to documents obtained by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a>, the lawyers state that “based on newly discovered facts and information that Juror No. 15 was not the individual summoned for jury duty on April 11, 2022.” They also attempted to<a href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;throw away</a> the verdict altogether where they claim that Depp’s compensatory award was “excessive” and “indefensible.” Heard’s spokesperson said of the mistrial filing, “While we realize today’s filing will ignite the Twitter bonfires, there are steps we need to take to ensure both fairness and justice,” a spokesperson for Heard said about appealing, adding they “believe the court made errors that prevented a just and fair verdict consistent with the First Amendment.” However, Judge Penney Azcarte denied the mistrial.</p><p>Heard also <a href=# rel=noopener>sold her house</a> amid reports that she is broke. She owes Depp $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages for a total of $15 million. Due to the cap on punitive damages under Virginia state law, Judge Penney Azcarate reduced Heard’s punitive damages from $5 million to $350,000.&nbsp; Heard will have to pay Depp a total of $8.35 million in damages, accounting for the $2 million in compensatory damages he owes her. Heard’s lawyer, Elaine Bredehoft, told Today on June 2, 2022, that her client can “absolutely not” afford to pay Depp the $10.35 million she owes Depp in damages. “Oh no. Absolutely not, “Bredehoft said when asked if Heard has the money to afford Depp’s damages.</p><p>A source told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The New York Post</a>&nbsp;at the time that Heard is “broke” due to legal fees and her past lavish spending on travel, clothes, gifts and wine. The newspaper also reported that Heard had to change legal representation during the trial and is using her homeowner’s insurance from the insurance firm The Travelers Companies to cover the cost of her current attorneys. Pamela Johnson, the vice president of The Travelers Companies, has also been seen with Heard in court in Fairfax, Virginia, multiple times since the trial started in April 2022. Heather Heidelbaugh, a Pennsylvania-based trial attorney, told The New York Post that it’s not uncommon for defendants to use homeowner’s insurance policies in defamation cases. “It’s a little oddity that most people don’t know. In most homeowner insurance policies, there is coverage if you are sued for defamation based on how much you pay through coverage, ”she said.</p><p>If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, help is available.
