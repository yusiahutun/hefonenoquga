In fact, their influence on contemporary country was given much more weight than other factors in building the Top 50. For example, both <a href=#>Hank Williams</a> and <a href=#>Hank Williams Jr.</a> are legends worthy of Top 10 status.

We did our best to explain&nbsp;the ranking for each of these 50 classic country artists, especially as it pertains to matters of influence.</p><p>To qualify as classic country, an artist needs to have notched a hit song or notable achievement prior to 1990. For this reasons, modern legends including&nbsp;<a href=#>Tim McGraw</a>, <a href=#>Toby Keith</a>, <a href=#>Brooks & Dunn</a> and <a href=#>Shania Twain</a> do not make the cut. Others whose influence has timed out also miss out on our list.</p><p>Strength of catalog and success in retail stores and on country radio will move a classic country artist higher on this list. The top artists do all of this, and lead the way in some other tangible way, like an innovation, or business or how he or she approaches the career in the later years.</p><p>No. 1 is an icon known for so much more than music.
