Kanye has been a constant headline topic in recent weeks. Whether it‚Äôs for his public Instagram feud with estranged wife Kim Kardashian ‚Äì who has now been declared single ‚Äì his latest album Donda, or jeen-yuhs‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs been plenty.
However, a lot of attention towards his online feuds was instead drawn to his three-part docuseries jeen-yuhs."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Coodie is barely seen on the Netflix show, but his skills are displayed throughout.</p><p>Now the series‚Äô principal cinematographer and narrator, Chicago-born Coodie previously worked in the comedy industry before securing a job on a local hip hop station where <a href=#>Kanye</a>‚Äòs name kept coming up.</p><p>After arranging an interview with the rapper, he ended up following Ye‚Äôs journey across the USA. New Orleans resident Chike, on the other hand, was working in design motion graphics for MTV when he met Coodie for the first time.</p><p>Chike had been learning video craft in Savannah College of Art and Design, and moved to New York where he secured the MTV job. Coodie had recently moved to the big city after feeling the need to follow Kanye‚Äôs success.</p><p>He was producing MTV‚Äôs You Heard It First, a series that featured up-and-coming artists, and was about to film an episode with Kanye. After that moment, the duo decided to collaborate and have been working together ever since.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ok thanks to my friendüíöüíì-so Coodie & Chike were friends.</p><p>Chike‚Äô is from NOLA.

Coodie told <a href=#>Netflix Tudum</a>:</p><p>The first parts covering everything up to The College Dropout, God wrote all that already. It was right there in the footage. But part three was definitely the most challenging, because first, me and Kanye had a separation period. During that time, I would watch Kanye like everybody else would watch him. I had no communications with him, but then God brought us back together.</p><p>While making the documentary, they realised that Kanye had a highly-driven work ethic, but realised that they also had the same amount of motivation when it comes to creating films.</p><p>The series comes after Chike made the decision years ago to quit MTV and work with Coodie, leading to the 2022-released documentary detailing Kanye‚Äôs lead-up to the rap industry.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Chike and Coodie >>>>>>>>>>>>>> <a href=#>#JeenYuhs</a></p>‚Äî Ms. Williams (@YemisiSL) <a href=#>March 3, 2022</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-their-net-worth-after-netflix-debut>Their net worth after Netflix debut</h2><p>Chike is currently worth $500,000, while Coodie has an estimated net worth of $1.5 million.
