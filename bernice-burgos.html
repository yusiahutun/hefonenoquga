She is of Puerto Rican descent. She was forced to leave out of school at the tender age of 15 due to an unanticipated pregnancy. Despite the fact that she never married her boyfriend, she lived with his mother after being rejected by her own grandma. She acknowledged in one of the interviews that she was obliged to do all of the housework and cook since she couldn’t afford to pay the rent. Burgos was also responsible for raising her daughter while enduring an abusive relationship with her boyfriend. She keeps her personal life private while being such a public figure. She never brought up her parents or siblings in conversation. Bernice is a high school dropout with little information on her post-secondary schooling.</p><h3>Bernice Burgos Career</h3><p>She started working as a bartender after dropping out of school. She also got into modeling, which led to her becoming a video vixen. Because of her outstanding personality and curvy form, she was preferred by photographers and magazine editors. Her career began with appearances in publications including SHOW and XXL. She made her first appearance in one of J. Cole’s music videos for the song Work Out. She made an appearance in Rick Ross’ Diced Pineapples video three years later. Bernice was well compensated for her modeling work and working as a bartender, but she still yearned for her own business. As a result, she and her daughter Ashley created the Bold and Beautiful apparel line. Bold and Beautiful is a clothing label aimed primarily at women.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u4bcea10bfb864d002f805c6ad04f38d9><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Nick Bencivengo Biography</span></a><h4>Controversies</h4><p>Bernice Burgos flaunts her great curvy body on social media, which has led to suspicions of plastic surgery. She has admitted to getting breast and hip augmentations in order to sustain her career. On December 14, 2010, Bernice was arrested by the Bergen County Prosecutor’s Office Sex Crimes and Child Abuse Unit for physically assaulting a 14-year-old girl. She was charged with a crime of the second degree.</p><p>T.I.’s ex-wife has accused her of being unfaithful. Tiny (T.I.’s ex-wife) claims that he cheated on her by having a physical relationship with the model. Bernice defended herself by claiming that their marriage was already gone and that she should not be held responsible. Physical relationships are natural, and sexual morse is fairly liberated in 2017. Meek Mill, a hip-hop star, has just developed a crush on her. Bernice hasn’t given it much thought so far.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Bernice Burgos Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Bernice Burgos</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>17 April 1980</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2021)</td><td>41 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Bronx, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Model</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>Aries</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Bernice-Burgos-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 7” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 170 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 65 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 143 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td>6.5 (U.S.)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Slim</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Qualification/Education</h3></th></tr><tr><td>School</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Bernice-Burgos-3.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Single</td></tr><tr><td>Boyfriend</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Ashley Burgos,&nbsp;Sarai Burgos</td></tr></tbody></table><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ud715939d0e9551cd77dc9f9e654e44a0><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Veronika Khomyn Biography</span></a><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>Bernice is the mother of two girls, one named Ashley and the other Sarai.
