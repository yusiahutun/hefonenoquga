The Pura 70’s system-on-a-chip (SOC) – an integrated circuit that combines all the necessary components on one piece of silicon – was identified as the Kirin 9010 processor manufactured by China’s top foundry Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), using its 7-nanometre N+2 node, the same process used to make the Kirin 9000s for Huawei’s Mate 60 Pro line, according to Dan Hutcheson, vice-chairman of US-based IC research company TechInsights."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Huawei has doubled down on building a full-stack ecosystem on several business fronts, from smartphones and AI computing to EV automobile solutions, which all require large quantities of module hardware and chips.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Huawei has totally broken free from US sanctions in China’s markets,” Hutcheson said. “But it’s still being held back by US sanctions in world markets.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Huawei is expected to ship over 50 million handsets in China this year, putting it back in the top spot with a 19 per cent market share, up from 12 per cent in 2023, TechInsights data showed. The resilience in China will help Huawei become the eighth largest smartphone vendor worldwide with a 5 per cent market share despite the Pura 70 line likely to be unavailable in overseas markets.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">SMIC and Huawei did not immediately respond to requests for comment sent outside business hours on Sunday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/28/b57a3ea5-2e35-44a5-9001-cb8eb04be3e1_a9a6f86b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As with the Mate 60 Pro line, Huawei has been tight-lipped about the Pura 70’s SOC, in regard to its suppliers, manufacturers and design specifications. The Mate 60 Pro 7-nm chip has put the US government at unease and triggered more threats of scrutiny from Washington.</p>Huawei’s 5G-capable Mate 60 Pro series released last August has already tilted the market equilibrium, as it helped win over market share from <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Apple</span></a> during the first quarter in the overall Chinese smartphone market and the premium segment priced over US$600, according to research firm IDC.One of the key bottlenecks facing Huawei last year was its supply-chain capacity, which could not keep up with the robust demand for the Mate 60 Pro, leading to <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">constraints in production</span></a>, partly due to low yields for the advanced Kirin 9000s processor.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The situation could be the same for Huawei with the Pura 70 series. “Huawei’s semiconductor supply challenges are lack of advanced node density, power, performance, and cost,” according to Hutcheson.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwaavx2iZop9dqbKktI6aqa2hk6GycH%2BRb2dvcWNktbat1p6grGWgqr%2BieZZpZKylkafBsbTOp5xmm5%2BjwaK1zaxkp52nYoRuusxmn6KrmaG2pLvNZpqhoaBiuqKwxGarqKhdmLWqusSsnGaen6q7pb7YZqqmoZNiwKLF0g%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
