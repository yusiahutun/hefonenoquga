The <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> were first introduced at New York Fashion Week during a party in Manhattan, and Melania was 24 years his junior. Fast-forward almost three decades, and they’ve already had a <a href=#>stint in the White House</a>. But Donald says his wife <a href=#>Melania Trump</a> wouldn’t be upset if he was seriously injured, in a previous interview.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-donald-trump-on-his-wife-s-reaction-if-something-tragic-happened>Donald Trump on his wife’s reaction if something tragic happened</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-1151196373-1024x715.jpg><p>In 2019, when <a href=#>First Lady Melania</a> and Donald were living in one of the most famous buildings in the world, he cracked a joke on how his wife wouldn’t have cracked with grief if there was a Trump tragedy.</p><p>Whilst at a Republican fundraiser, the former POTUS made the comment after Rep Steve Scalise was wounded in a mass shooting two years earlier. The 77-year-old was speaking about how his wife was beside herself during his recovery.</p><p><a href=#>Donald Trump</a> said: “[Scalise’s spouse] cried her eyes out when I met her at the hospital that fateful day… I mean, not many wives would react that way to tragedy. I know mine wouldn’t”.</p><p>He cracked the joke during his hour-long speech, where he was “unscripted, unfiltered and totally in his element”.</p><p>But it may have added to the <a href=#>celebrity</a>‘s awkward interactions with the former First Lady, while under the spotlight. Recently, there was one moment where it looked like <a href=#>Melania didn’t want to hold his hand</a>, as per a body language expert.</p><p>These instances have been picked up by fans and cameras over the years, before and after the Presidency.</p><p>There has also been rumors of infidelity rumors revolving around <a href=#>Donald Trump and his wife</a>, but she has said it didn’t faze her at all.</p><p>She previously told ABC news: “It is not a concern and focus of mine.</p><p>“I’m a mother and a First Lady and I have much more important things to think about and to do. I know people like to specialty and the media like to speculate about our marriage.”</p><p>Melania added: “It’s not always pleasant, of course. But I know what is right and what is wrong and what is true or not true”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-trump-dating-timeline>Trump dating timeline</h2><p>The pair met at the glitzy party in 1998, but at the time, Donald actually had a date. He asked for Melania’s number, but she didn’t want to, as there was a woman with him. Instead, she called him.</p><p>She admitted she was “struck by his energy”, and Melania began dating the <a href=#>real estate</a> mogul. By 2004, Donald dropped to one knee to propose at the <a href=#>Met Gala</a>, and tied the knot in January 2005.</p><p>A year later, they welcomed their son, <a href=#>Barron Trump</a>. Donald shares sons Donald Trump Jr and Eric, as well as daughter Ivanka with his ex-wife Ivana. He is also father to Tiffany, from his ex-wife Maria Maples, who was born in 1993.</p><p>During Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign for the Oval Office, his wife Melania explained they have their independence during the marriage.</p><p>She told MSNBC’s Morning Joe, they “have a great relationship.”</p><p>“We are our own people. I’m my own person,” she added. “He’s his own person. And I think that’s very important.</p><p>“I don’t want to change him. He doesn’t want to change me”.</p><p>But Melania has always been the doting wife to Donald Trump, even when he faced controversies as President. She did admit they don’t always see ‘eye to eye’ though.</p><p>She once said during a trip to Egypt in 2018: “I don’t always agree with what he thinks, and I tell him that. I give him my honest opinion and honest advice”.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2eDcLDOp5ilnF2pv7a5z2aqmrGjYsSqssRmpJ6kkaO2onnWqKylnJ6perS0xJ1kmmWkmq6zecifZKynnZrBqbXNoGStqpGctqR5x5qnqZ2emrFuwM5mn6KlXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
