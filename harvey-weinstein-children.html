The disgraced Hollywood mogul is currently serving his sentence in prison after a string of sexual assault allegations.</p><p>Allegations against the Hollywood producer in 2017 ushered in the #MeToo movement that highlighted the pervasive sexual assault cases in workplaces, especially in entertainment. More than 80 women have accused Weinstein of non-consensual sex for nearly three decades. According to Twohey and Kantor, Weinstein had&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>been paying off his accusers</a>&nbsp;for years. Their investigation revealed the former king of Hollywood had reached settlements with eight women, including a young assistant in New York in 1990, an actress in 1997, an assistant in London in 1998, an Italian model in 2015 and a colleague, Lauren O’Connor shortly after. In a statement to&nbsp;The Times&nbsp;on October 5, 2017, Weinstein said: “I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a lot of pain</a>, and I sincerely apologize for it. Though I’m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go.”</p><p>On December 19, 2022, a Los Angeles jury found Weinstein guilty of rape but overall, delivered a mixed verdict after deliberating for nine days. He was convicted of raping and sexually assaulting an actress in 2013. In total, he faced seven charges—two of rape and five of sexual assault—stemming from accusations involving four women from 2004 to 2013. He was found guilty of three, rape, forcible oral sex and sexual penetration, involving an Italian actress who testified Weinstein attacked her in 2013. On February 23, 2023, Weinstein was sentenced to 16 years in prison, meaning he’ll spend the rest of his life behind bars.</p><p>In a 4-3 vote, the New York Court of Appeals found that the judge <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1768738/harvey-weinstein-still-in-prison/>presiding the case</a> prejudiced the ex-movie mogul with “egregious” improper rulings, including a decision to let women testify about allegations that weren’t part of the case. “We conclude that the trial court erroneously admitted testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts against persons other than the complainants of the underlying crimes,” the court’s 4-3 decision said. “The remedy for these egregious errors is a new trial.”</p><p>Weinstein married his assistant Eve Chilton in 1987 and had three daughters with her. The two divorced in 2004 and the disgraced producer moved on with model Georgia Campbell. They had two children together, a daughter and a son. Amid the allegations directed towards him, Campbell announced she was divorcing him and that his older children were no longer in contact with their father.</p><p>Weinstein’s defence lawyer Donna Rotunno revealed where his eldest daughters stood amid the trial.</p><p>She said, “His oldest daughters don’t speak to him. So I mean it’s horrific. The ripple effect of someone losing their freedom is beyond what any of us could comprehend.” However, she emphasized that he was on good terms with his youngest. She said, “He’s been seeing the younger kids their whole lives. They live next door to each other, he has a great relationship with his younger children.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=harvey-weinstein-s-children>Harvey Weinstein’s Children</h2><p>So who are Harvey Weinstein’s children?

She was crying, so he left his therapy and went to her house on Wednesday morning to comfort her.</p><p>The source continued, “Then Harvey thought he saw the paparazzi parked outside her house, and he didn’t want his daughter to be drawn into the media maelstrom, he doesn’t want them to be outside her home or knocking on her door, so he immediately left her house and ran down the street in order to leave as quickly as possible.</p><p>“Remy overreacted at the situation, out of love and concern for her father, and called the police, telling them he was depressed and suicidal.

They spoke to top actors, former Weinstein employees and other sources about long-buried allegations against the former head of Miramax and The Weinstein Company, the film studios responsible for producing classics such as Good Will Hunting, Kill Bill, and Shakespeare in Love. After publishing their first piece on October 5, 2017, women from all over the world came forward with their stories, shedding light on shadowy settlements, secret payouts and nondisclosure agreements that kept Weinstein’s abuses private, only rumored about, for decades.
