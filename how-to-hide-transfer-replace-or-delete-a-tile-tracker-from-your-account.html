Here's how to hide a Tile from your account, transfer in a&nbsp;replacement Tile, or delete a Tile altogether.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Use Tile to Find Your Keys, Wallet, or Anything Else</a></span></p><p>Since a Tile tracker is connected to your phone and can be used to locate important items like your keys, phone, or wallet, the company doesn't make it easy to remove them. The last thing you want is for a thief to immediately remove your tracker so you can't find your stuff. If you need to get rid of an old Tile from your account, there are a few ways to do it and they all work a little differently:</p><ul><li><strong>Hide a Tile:</strong> If you have a Tile in your list that has a dead battery or you just don't care about seeing it anymore, you can temporarily hide it. This will still keep the Tile active on your account, but you won't get notifications about it and it won't show up in your Tile list. You can unhide a Tile from&nbsp;the Settings menu at any time.</li><li><strong>Transfer a Tile:</strong> This option lets you give your Tile away to someone else. You'll need to contact Tile's customer support to do this.</li><li><strong>Replace a Tile:</strong> Eventually, the non-removable battery in your Tile will die. When that happens, you can buy a new Tile and replace your old Tile with the new one. This step will deactivate your old Tile.</li><li><strong>Delete a Tile:</strong> If you want to remove a Tile from your account entirely, you'll need to contact Tile's customer support. This is the nuclear option. Once a Tile is deactivated, it can't be reactivated on any account, for security reasons. If you want to give your Tile away or just hide it for a while, use one of the other options.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Generally, you won't want to&nbsp;delete a Tile, but we'll go through how to use each option.</p><h2 id=hide-a-tile-from-your-list>Hide a Tile From Your List</h2><p>To temporarily hide a Tile from your&nbsp;account, open up the Tile app.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/deletetile01-324.png><p>Swipe across the Tile you want to hide from right to left to reveal a menu.

Before you do, though, you'll need a few pieces of information.</p><ul><li>Your email address.</li><li>The email address of the person you want to transfer your Tile to.</li><li>The Tile ID of the Tile you're transferring.</li></ul><p>You'll have the first part already, naturally. Make sure your friend has downloaded the Tile app for <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Android</a> or <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">iOS</a>&nbsp;and ask them for the email address they used to sign up. The last bit is&nbsp;a little trickier. To find your Tile ID, open the Tile app and swipe the Tile you want to transfer to the left. Tap Edit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/deletetile06-324.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Towards the bottom of the screen, you'll see an alphanumeric string next to&nbsp;Tile Identifier (in the area that is blurred out in the photo below).&nbsp;Write down this&nbsp;string.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/deletetile06-324.png><p>Once you have this information, email Tile's support at&nbsp;<a href=#>team@thetileapp.com</a>&nbsp;from the email address associated with your account.

After you've had a Tile for eleven months, you can opt into <a href=#>Tile's reTile program</a> to get a replacement for cheaper than the normal retail price. Once you have your replacement, open up the app. Swipe left on the Tile you want to replace and tap Edit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/deletetile06-324.png><p>At the bottom of the screen, tap "Replace this Tile."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/deletetile10-324.png><p>On the next two screens, select which type of&nbsp;Tile you're replacing your old device with.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_5942fd0e3c0cb.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tile11-324.png><p>Next,&nbsp;click the Tile logo in the center of your new device and place it next to your phone.

Even if you're done with a Tile forever, hiding it will have the same effect as deleting it from a practical standpoint. However, if you want to get rid of a Tile and make absolutely certain that no one else can ever use it again, you'll need to contact Tile support. There are a few ways to do that.</p><ul><li><strong>Chat support:</strong> To chat with Tile online, open up any page on <a href=#>Tile's online Help Center</a>, hover over the blue How Can We Help? tab at the bottom of the screen and click Live Support. This will let you start a conversation with a Tile representative. Note: This is only available from 8:30AM to 5:30PM Pacific.</li><li><strong>Email support:</strong>&nbsp;If you'd rather speak via email (or can't contact Tile during the daytime), you can <a href=#>submit a support request through this form</a>.</li></ul><p>Again, deleting your Tile is an ordeal, so you probably won't want to do it unless you absolutely need to disable a Tile completely. Once you delete your Tile, it will be completely unusable. You'll never be able to enable&nbsp;it again and no one else will ever be able to use it on their account either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhqamlgbIVwtM6wZK2nXZ22pbGMramapqObsrN50Z6npZmTmnqwvoydnKWdpJp6onnToqOeZaSnrqS3xKtkn6qfonq6u9SrZJqbk6TCr8CO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
