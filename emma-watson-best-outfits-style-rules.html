Then, we rewatch the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Harry Potter movies</a>, remember Emma Watson is now in her 30s, and suddenly, we've traveled back to reality.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gone are the days when we immediately associated the actress with Hermoine Granger; she's now Belle from Beauty and the Beast, Meg from Little Women, a UN ambassador, a women's rights activist, and a full-blown fashion icon, often making a statement about the importance of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sustainable clothing</a>. To be honest, it's kind of hard to connect the Watson we know today with that same little girl from 20 years ago.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, there are some ways this multi-hyphenate hasn't changed, even while adding to her super impressive resumé. Watson's best dresses and outfits from recent years are awfully similar to those she once wore as a child, and it's easy to see that, in many ways, her style preferences haven't changed at all, they've simply evolved and become more refined.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To prove that Watson has been pulling the same fashion tricks for decades, we've gone back in time and put together some side-by-sides. It turns out, she's still loving suits, splashes of gold, and creative layering — all of which should be great news for the star, as so many <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>old trends continue to resurface</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-accessorizing-with-drop-earrings></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Accessorizing with Drop Earrings</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Studs are sweet, hoops are cool and classic, but nothing makes a statement or looks quite as fancy as Watson's go-to: Shiny, sparkling drops. For her, there's more than one way to work this accessory into her look, and oftentimes, she'll step out wearing a single earring instead of a set.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-opting-for-a-suit></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Opting For a Suit</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Watson's gowns are always breathtaking, but at the same time, she's a pro at pulling off a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>smart suit</a>, whether it's traditional black and white or colorful with a print. It's just another way she enjoys mixing things up on the red carpet, and she's kept this look in her rotation since 2002.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-amping-up-white-outfits></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Amping Up White Outfits</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's true: We often worry that neutral items will feel boring without that big pop of color. However, Watson knows it's all about finding pieces with special details, as well as some creative layering. Throughout her career, she's stepped out in plenty of playful all-white ensembles, whether it's a skirt with a subtle print, a dress with not-so-basic sleeves, or a three-piece suit accessorized with a wide-brim hat.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-throwing-on-a-leather-jacket></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Throwing On a Leather Jacket</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This jacket style has topped Watson's outfits for nearly two decades. While her picks have ranged from blazers to moto designs, it doesn't take a way from the fact that this layer is super versatile, with the ability to be paired with everything from breezy maxis to tiny mini skirts.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-layering-a-t-shirt-underneath></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Layering a T-shirt Underneath</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In case you're tempted to write off the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>white-tee </a>as your average, unexciting wardrobe staple, take a look at how Watson uses one to tone down fancy designs. She'll occasionally layer a white tee underneath sequins or LBDs, making her red carpet look a lot more wearable and less over-the-top.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-breezing-by-in-floor-length-gowns></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Breezing By in Floor Length Gowns</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whenever Watson goes all out for a red carpet, she doesn't overdo it. A layered dress with bits of lace or tulle is enough of a wow factor that she'll keep her accessories and footwear simple — a great reminder for your next formal event.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-wearing-pants-under-dresses></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Wearing Pants Under Dresses</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In theory, this combination sounds risky, but Watson proves it's fairly easy to pull off. The key is to make sure a decent portion of your leg is on display, so style slacks with a mini or a gown with a revealing slit. This way, you'll be able to get a good look at the contrast and the pairing will feel intentional.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-styling-white-tops-with-black-bottoms></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Styling White Tops with Black Bottoms</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We tend to view white and black combos as the epitome of sleek and classic, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to have fun with this look. Take a note from Watson and work something unexpected into your ensemble, such as a bow belt or lace-up flats, which are sure to spice things up.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-showing-her-shoulders></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Showing Her Shoulders</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A solid, structured, off-the-shoulder dress styled with dainty drops is a combination that comes across as elegant and regal — which is probably why Watson has turned to similar styles again and again. When it works, it works — and is perfectly fine to repeat!</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-embracing-metallic-details></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Embracing Metallic Details</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Watson is no stranger to stealing the spotlight, but oftentimes, she manages to do so subtly and simply, ensuring there are fun details in her outfit, like a splash of metallic. This doesn't just mean sequins, either; the actress attended 2018's Vanity Fair Oscar Party wearing a long black gown with an embellished, chain-linked neckline, ensuring her look wouldn't be missed.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-belting-dresses></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Belting Dresses</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We just began re-embracing this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>waist-cinching trick</a>, but it seems the actress never truly gave it up. Whenever her mini or maxi seemed to be missing a little something, she reached for both wide and thin belts to give things a boost and add interest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8SmpJplp5bBtLvNaJympZFixKLA0qilZpqVqMFuu9StnaKso2LAtcXLnmSrrZyawA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
