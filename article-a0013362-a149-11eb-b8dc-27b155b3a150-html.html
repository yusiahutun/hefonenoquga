•
The wife of an accused child abuser said that her husband’s arrest was the result of a misunderstanding.
The 4-year-old boy — who was reported as the victim in the case that was in Saturday’s edition — has a speech problem, and he was trying to say “doggie” caused the bruise on the back of his thigh, not “daddy,” Brianna Taylor said in a message to the reporter."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He said what to me sounded like ‘daddy got me.’”</span></p><p><span>When she repeated the phrase to him, asking if “daddy got him,” he said, “no, shaking his head over and over but every time he said ‘no’ when I said daddy got him,” Taylor continued.</span></p><p><span>“Finally, frustrated, he walked over to the dog and said, ‘daddy got me’ again.
