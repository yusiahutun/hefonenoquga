The &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; star shows off his tickets to the gun show in the new issue of GQ, where he also opens up about going nude on the HBO series, his &#34;greasy&#34; hair and the show's upcoming fourth season.
While he showed some skin in &#34;Pompeii&#34; earlier this year, fans may be surprised to know they haven't seen as much of him on the show as they think."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And though we got a glimpse of Jon's rear-end as he jumped into the rock pool, it wasn't Kit's!</p><p>"When it came down to it I had a broken ankle, so the only time you saw my ass, it wasn't my ass," he tells the mag.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a6/o/2014/03/26/a657c65d48b95130a380fa24cd9c1676_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>But he's not opposed to going naked in the future either -- adding, "It's only right, if you're going to make a show where nudity and sex is a large part of it, that you be a part of that."</p><p>One aspect of his costume he does have a slight problem with is his hair, which he's contracted to keep grown-out long.</p><p>"It does keep you restricted. I can't go off and play a U.S. Marine," he says. "I like it to look greasy and medieval, so it gets very tangled. By the end it's pretty horrible."</p><p>As for the new season, Harington says it's going to be a violent one.</p><p>"It's getting worse," he tells the magazine. "What I wonder is how people can deal with something going dark and dark and darker. Being unrelenting in how pessimistic things are. They really push it."</p><p>We'll see how far they go when the new season premiere April 6.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d2/o/2014/03/26/d226926596b35cd88d1a4eb00adeebd3_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2JlfnV7j2xma25foLa1eceaqaKml6m8r3nNmqKenF2crq6xjKidZqyYp7yvsdJmma6spGKxsMHBpZxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
