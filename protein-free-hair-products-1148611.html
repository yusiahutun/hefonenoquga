I know it’s a sort-of weird request, but anyone with low-porosity hair understands my conundrum. Unless you read and research the ingredients list of all your hair care products, chances are you didn’t know that a large majority of products have protein in them.</p><p>For me, this was an eye-opening moment at the beginning of my current <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hair growth routine</a>. Initially, I took the wrong approach by simply drowning my hair in products that claimed to help promote quicker growth instead of slowing down and getting reacquainted with my hair first. First, I perused the drugstore and local beauty supply stores for nourishing and strengthening <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hair masks</a>. I immediately started using them a couple of days a week. Next, I started incorporating <a data-pmc-sp-product=8e4a5139b45c0b8f7e93c6e1ff56c431 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"protein powder","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"NeoCell Super Collagen Peptides, 10g Collagen Peptides per Serving, Gluten Free, Keto Friendly, Non-GMO, Grass Fed, Healthy Hair, Skin, Nails and Joints, Unflavored Powder, 7 oz., 1 Canister","price":"14.24","id":"B0011DJ71I","category":"Collagen"},"id":1148611,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>protein powder</a> (if you want longer, stronger nails: it works!) into my morning smoothie. Every. Single. Day. I also re-upped on a daily <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">conditioner</a> and went through a revolving door of daily <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">moisturizers</a>. Oh, and I started a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hair vitamin</a>, too.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>In hindsight, wow, it was too much, too fast. But after years of being generally impatient with my routine, stay-at-home orders and a renewed mindset forced me to realize that I was long overdue for a change. After about a month of doing all of this (along with not <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">trimming my hair</a>—a big no-no) and realizing that my hair was in progressively worse shape, I knew something was amiss. So I started by reading my hair product labels. And this is when my journey took a turn for the better.</p><p>Being that most salons are closed, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTuber</a> advice is hit-or-miss, I decided to go the long way around and start Googling every single ingredient on the back of the bottle. Soon enough, I learned two things: protein is in everything and protein has more than one name to look out for. Of course, the most obvious ingredients are ones that include the word “protein,” but there are also “amino acids,” “hydrolyzed” anything, “wheat,” and “collagen.” Here are the ones I encountered the most:</p><ul><li>Hydrolyzed protein</li><li>Silk Amino Acids</li><li>Hydrolyzed collagen</li><li>Rice complex</li><li>Keratin</li><li>Oat Flour</li></ul><p>There are so many more, but the takeaway here is that you shouldn’t put a product in your hair until you one, understand how your hair’s behavior, and two, know the ingredients inside the product. (Beginner tip: the first five ingredients on a label are the ones to pay the most attention to because ingredients are listed according to the amount, from most to least.) I’m also not bashing protein. Protein is good! Our hair needs it to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stay strong</a> and shiny. However, the way each of us uses it depends on our individual hair needs, so take the time to test and observe what you’re threshold is. Generally speaking, those with low porosity hair (or hair that struggles to retain water) can’t use protein as aggressively as others.</p><p>To get my hair back into fighting shape, I had to ban protein products completely for a couple of weeks. Once conditions improved, I put together a routine that isn’t completely protein-free but doesn’t include a lot of it, either. If you find that protein-rich products leave your hair brittle, dry, and matted, here are some of my favorite protein-free products (including one exception) for nursing your hair strands back to health.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-doux-one-love-co-wash.png><h2>My Exception: The Doux One Love Co-Wash</h2><p>I stick to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">this clarifying shampoo</a> for my weekly cleanse but during weeks when my hair is especially dirty, I use this multiuse product for a mini, mid-week wash day. It contains Silk Amino Acid but is listed near the very bottom of the ingredient list which means there probably isn’t an overabundance for me to worry about. Plus, it has amazing slip, leaves my hair feeling clean and soft, and smells amazing.</p><h2 class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-title-lg data-transform data-truncate>The Doux One Love Co-Wash</h2><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$12.99</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hairizon-aloe-water.png><h2>Hairizon Aloe Water</h2><p>I discovered this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Black-owned brand</a> after experimenting with aloe vera gel.
