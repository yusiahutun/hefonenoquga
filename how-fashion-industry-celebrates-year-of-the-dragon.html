This year, like magic, an opportunity came along to host a night with Moss for friends with mah-jongg, great drinks, and food.

On the actual Lunar New Year day, we closed the Beverly’s store for a team lunch with our friends and designers. I ordered a ton of Wu’s Wonton King and brought in a Vietnamese dish called banh chung—sticky rice mung bean and pork belly wrapped in banana leaf—that my parents shipped to me overnight from California.
