He’d draw people and animals, and I would try to copy them.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3>In seventh grade, she competed in her first Doodle for Google contest. The annual themed art competition geared toward K-12 students awards one grand prize winner a $30,000 college scholarship, a $50,000 technology package for their school, and the opportunity to have their doodle emblazoned on the search engine’s landing page for an entire day.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2022/09/Araque-Liu-with-her-mom-Tsing-yi-and-her-winning-Google-illustration.-Photography-by-Steven-Martine-683x1024.jpg><p class=p3><span class=s2>After entering her doodles three years in a row, she had decided to give up on the competition. But then she heard what the theme was for 2022: “I Care for Myself By…” At the time, Araque-Liu was struggling with performance anxiety heightened by the pandemic, and the theme really spoke to her. “What helped me the most during that time was accepting support from my family and friends, so I wanted to focus my artwork on that,” she says. “I also thought it was a message other people needed to hear.”</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>In her digital illustration, </span><span class=s3><i>Not Alone, </i></span><span class=s2>Araque-Liu and her mother are portrayed in a loving </span>embrace incorporated into the Google logo. “It felt right because it’s such an intimate form of love,” she says. “It’s comforting just knowing someone is there to support you.”</p><p class=p3><span class=s3><i>Not Alone</i></span><span class=s2> impressed the public, whose votes made </span>Araque-Liu Florida’s state winner in July, landing her a spot as a national finalist.

I used to be the type of person who would bottle everything up and try pushing through it alone. But I’ve come to realize that it’s okay not to shoulder the burden all on your own. That was the message I tried to communicate in <span class=s4><i>Not Alone</i></span>. I also wanted to thank my parents and friends for all their support, and I thought this would be a great opportunity to do that.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2022/09/Araque-Liu-surrounded-by-some-of-her-artwork.-Photography-by-Steven-Martine-683x1024.jpg><p class=p5><b><i>Were your parents aware of your struggles with anxiety?</i></b><span class=s5><b><i><span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></i></b></span></p><p class=p2>Whenever I wasn’t feeling well, I would shut myself in my room. We’re all online these days, so it’s easy to withdraw into yourself. But eventually, I came out and discussed what I was feeling, and my parents were very supportive. It started with one conversation that had to be unpacked over a longer course of time.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p5><b><i>What advice would you give to others dealing with anxiety?</i></b><span class=s6><span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p2>I would encourage people to understand that those around them care and love them. They also want to help. Anxiety isn’t something you should be embarrassed to talk about.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p5><b><i>How did you find out you won the contest?</i></b><span class=s5><b><span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></b></span></p><p class=p2>Google had requested a Zoom interview with me this summer, saying it was for their social media channels. I figured they were doing interviews with all the finalists. During our <span class=s1>conversation, the interviewer said she needed </span>to speak with a coworker and turned the camera off for a minute. When it came back on, Selena Gomez was seated in the chair! She congratulated me and told me I was the national winner of Doodle for Google. I was so shocked and amazed!</p><p class=p5><b><i>What else did you and Selena chat about?</i></b><span class=s5><b><span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></b></span></p><p class=p2>I think she said she loved my artwork and the message behind it, about seeking help when you need it. I was kind of blubbering the whole time, which is too bad because I remember thinking that if I got the chance to meet Selena, there were so many things I wanted to say to her. We talked for maybe 10 minutes.</p><p class=p2><span class=s7><b><i>What was it like seeing your artwork posted on the Google home page in August?</i><br></b></span></p><p class=p2><span class=s2>Incredible! I’ll be honest, I kept Googling random things just to see it up there. It made me smile. It was insanely cool knowing so many people around the world would<br>see it and the message behind it.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tMDUmqmtpZGcrru1zZ5lnKedZMC1wcCrq2akmZuycLzEqKelnV%2BisqbAjKCjqJqRoXq0sc2smK2hn6N6tLvPoaCeZZGnrrLBxGajoq1f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
