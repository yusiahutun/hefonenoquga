He was raised alongside his brother, Payson Schnabel.</p><p class=align-left>Parker Schnabel's grandfather owned a mining company, Big Nugget. As a result, Russell was involved in mining since he was a young boy. He learnt how to operate heavy machinery before his feet could even touch the pedals.</p><p class=align-left>After his elementary studies, he enrolled at Haines High School. After high school graduation, he intended to join<a href=# title> college </a>to further his knowledge in geology or mining. He hoped to return to the family's mine after completing his studies.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, it didn't turn out as planned as he made the controversial choice. Instead of going to college, he decided to move away from his home mining area seeking new fortunes. He used his college fund for his operations in Yukon Territory.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/44a1c83012c4c607.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Percy Gibson: Net worth, nationality, career, wedding, family</span></p></a><h3>Career</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/293ffacadeba12b8.png><p class=align-left>Parker began his career under the <a href=#>family</a> mining <a href=#>business</a> when he was still a school pupil.
