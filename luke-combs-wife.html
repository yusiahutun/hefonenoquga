They met through mutual friends at a music festival while he was a rising star in Nashville, while she worked as a recruiting coordinator at Broadcast Music Inc.</p><p>“I could tell she was different than anybody I had ever met,” Combs told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Nashville Lifestyles</a>. Hocking added, “I realized we could hang out and just be ourselves in front of each other. I could wear no makeup and be my weird self — because we’re all weird, but we get to choose who to share that side of us with. We could be each other’s weird in front of each other. That’s when it was like, ‘You know what? This guy’s a keeper.'”</p><p>Combes revealed that a lot of people disapproved of their relationship since Combs was relatively unknown during that time. He told People, “Everybody was like, ‘Yeah, this is never gonna work’ and so I didn’t have anything when we met.”</p><p>The two later got engaged in 2018 after two years of dating. He revealed that he wrote his hit song “Beautiful Crazy” during the early stages, and it ended up being their first dance song. “‘Beautiful Crazy’ for me … I mean [it] won song of the year [at the 2019 CMA Awards], which was probably the number one [goal] on my bucket list,” he recalled on <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://open.spotify.com/episode/0IuK2gwUUtWGX6rDN1EROO rel=nofollow>The Artist and The Athlete.</a></p><p>“I wrote that song about my wife before we were even dating [and it ended up being] the first dance at our wedding,” he says. “There’s no way that any other song will top that as far as sentimental value for me.”</p><p>“Oh, she loved it. She always deflects the attention [she felt] in that [moment], which I get. If someone played me a song about me [three, four months in], I would be probably pretty uncomfortable about it. So I get it.”</p><p>He called it a “total baller move for sure,” saying, “I’m not much of a ladies’ man. But I was pretty proud of this one. I had written it, maybe two days before [I played it for her].”</p><p>The happy couple married on August 1, 2020 at their home in Florida. The “Where The Wild Things Are” singer posted that<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/COOtWIRjlbU/ rel=nofollow> the ceremony</a> was “the best day of [his] life.” He added, “I got to marry my best friend. I love you @nicohocking, here’s to forever.” Footage of the wedding was shown in his music video in “Forever After All.” The bride also posted, “Yesterday was the most special day!! I’m so happy to spend the rest of my life with you! Although we wish we could have had every single one of our friends & family there, we can’t wait to celebrate with everyone next year! So excited to share more of this day soon. Much love!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfocKssYycpqaao2LEqrLEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
