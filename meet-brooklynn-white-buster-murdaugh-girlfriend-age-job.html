Buster Murdaugh, who has been dragged into the spotlight after the two homicides in his family, keeps himself away from the spotlight.</p><p>Richard Alexander “Buster” Murdaugh is the oldest of two sons of attorney Alex Murdaugh and his wife late <a href=#>Margaret (Maggie) Murdaugh</a>. His father is currently on a trial for the murder of his brother and his mom in June 2021.

Buster has been dating Brooklynn White for a very long time. They live together in a modest $180,000 condo on Hilton Head Island.</p><p>One of the neighbors at the time called the couple a “really nice couple” who usually “smile and say hi.” In addition, a dog named Miller is said to belong to the courting couple. Buster does not currently have a wife because they are not yet married. There aren’t many details about their relationship.</p><p>The Greenville News brought into light the plethora of witnesses related to Alex’s trial and Buster was one of them. However, he had also been in legal trouble before that also involved his late brother and his dad.</p><p>A former college classmate of Buster revealed to People Magazine in July 2021 that the oldest son of Alex wasn’t doing well at all. They added, “He really withdrew after everything happened. Before, he’d text immediately. His phone was surgically implanted in his hand or something like you’d send a text 24/7 and he’d respond, and he loved to chat. Now he doesn’t respond to most texts or, if he does, it’s one or two words. He has really closed off and built walls around himself.”</p><p>But, he responded when DailyMail reached out. He explained, “Presumably you’re supporting your father?” he replied, “You have no right to presume anything.” And he was adamant as he said, “I don’t want to see it written anywhere that I’m supporting my father.”</p><p>When asked if he wanted to comment further on his father’s guilt or innocence, he simply answered, “I have no interest in saying anything. I have no comment.”</p><p>A childhood friend of his has also stated he’s “collateral damage” to his father’s alleged actions. “His circle of friends got really small really fast… He’s really down…,” the friend said. “He doesn’t make eye contact and he doesn’t really engage like he used to. He looks tired. He’s aged like 10 years in the past year. He has bags under his eyes and he just looks miserable. It’s just a shame.”</p><h3><strong>Brooklynn White Age</strong></h3><p>As of February 2023, Brooklyn White is 26 years old.
