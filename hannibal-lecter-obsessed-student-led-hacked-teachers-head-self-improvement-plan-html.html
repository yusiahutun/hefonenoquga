In a crime that sent shock waves across Poland, Kajetan Poznanski was jailed in 2021 after telling judges he murdered the woman as part of a 'self-improvement plan'.
Now his lawyers are saying his sentence should be overturned.
Dubbed the 'Hannibal of Zoliborz' after the wealthy Warsaw district where he lived and his fascination with the fictional serial killer, in 2016 Poznanski went to the home of language teacher Katarzyna Jaroszyńska under the pretence of wanting to learn Italian."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Perhaps the leading motive was self-improvement, consisting in overcoming a certain taboo about deprivation of human life.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'His friends said that at some point they noticed his transformation, both physical and mental. They mentioned that there were elements of isolation and a very strong identification with the figure of Hannibal Lecter can be seen in his literary works.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'There are two options. One is that some fantasy world or idea has begun to develop that has arisen as a result of a personality disorder. The second possibility is that a psychotic process began to develop, culminating in this crime.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'These are two very important directions that expert psychiatrists will certainly explore.
