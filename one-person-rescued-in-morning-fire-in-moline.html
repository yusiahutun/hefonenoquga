We appreciate the community’s support and understanding during this challenging period.”</p><p><strong>EARLIER UPDATE:</strong> One person was rescued from a fire this morning in Moline and taken to a local hospital for treatment.</p><p>The Moline Fire Department was called to a structure fire in the 2400 block of 32nd Street on Wednesday, March 6 at about 3:56 a.m. First responders arrived within seven minutes and discovered a small, single-family home with smoke and fire coming from the rear of the building. Bystanders at the scene told fire crews they smelled smoke and noticed the home was on fire. They weren’t sure if anyone was inside the home.</p><p>The initial response included 17 on-duty personnel in three engine companies, an aerial unit, a command vehicle and two ambulances. Two off-duty Chief Officers responded to assist with scene and provide city coverage during the event. The Fire Marshal, Fire Inspector and Fire Investigator responded and are assisting with the investigation.</p><p>Crews entered the home and found a person inside. The person was rescued and taken to an ambulance, where paramedics provided lifesaving care and took the person to the hospital. The next arriving fire companies entered the home and continued an aggressive attack of the fire. The fire was brought under control in about 30 minutes, with crews remaining on the scene for two hours to complete overhaul and look for hidden fires. Firefighters were unsure if there were working smoke detectors at the home.</p><p>The East Moline, Rock Island and Arsenal Fire Departments, Moline Second Alarmers and MidAmerican Energy assisted at the scene. The fire is under investigation by the Moline Fire Department Bureau of Investigations</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaKannV2lsrO%2Fzqdkq52jmMKmsIyipWaln6e7qrrGZp2iqpVitq95zKijoqaVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
