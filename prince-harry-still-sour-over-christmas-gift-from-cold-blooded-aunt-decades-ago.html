The little prince had a heap of Christmas presents one year and decided to unpack the smallest one first. It was from “Aunt Margo.”</p><p>When the youngster opened the gift, he found it was a biro pen with a small rubber fish wrapped around it. The prince thought this was “cold-blooded” of her. He further discusses his distant relationship with the late <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>‘s younger sister. In Spare, Harry recalls how his great-aunt ‘didn’t have much of an opinion’ of him.&nbsp;He says that he too, felt nothing much for her except pity. The California resident also recalls always keeping out of her way.</p><p>Only on a few occasions have the two been pictured together. Princess Margaret died in 2002 after years of health struggles. She was 71 at the time of her passing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-duke-thinks-he-and-princess-margaret-had-a-lot-in-common>Duke thinks he and Princess Margaret had a lot in common</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1315951372-scaled-e1702481297401-1024x576.jpg><p>In his book, Prince Harry reveals he wished he and Aunt Margo could have been closer. He thinks the two of them had a lot in common with each other, given both of them were the “spare” as the limelight shone on their older siblings.</p><p>While <a href=#>Prince Harry and Prince William have had a feud</a> for years now, he notes Princess Margaret’s relationship with her older sister the Queen was also marked by “rivalry” and “intense competition.”&nbsp;</p><p>The 39-year-old wrote: “We had so much in common. Two spares. Her relationship with Granny wasn’t an exact analog of mine with Willy, but pretty close.”</p><p><a href=#>Meghan Markle</a>‘s husband also thinks Margaret had a lot in common with his mother, <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>. He notes how both women rebelled against tradition.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-margaret-was-terribly-loyal-to-the-queen-despite-jealousy>Margaret was “terribly loyal” to the Queen despite jealousy</h2><p>Although the two sisters had some sibling rivalry, Margaret’s lady-in-waiting Anne Glenconner, previously told People they had a close ond.</p><p>She said: “She was&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>terribly loyal to the Queen</a>&nbsp;— and being five years younger, I think it would have been much more difficult if she had been just [a little] younger than the Queen.</p><p>“I knew Princess Margaret very, very well. And of course, she was a spare for quite a long time. But I mean, she was always completely loyal to the Queen,” she told the outlet. However, as per Glenconner, the late Princess felt that she could have been better educated like her older sister.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2eCcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GaqraGcoXq0u9SrZKiulad6pLTRoqqtpZGoeqi1xa1kn6qfonqku8udZJukn6SxprCMmqynrF2ZsqStw56qZpmXpHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
