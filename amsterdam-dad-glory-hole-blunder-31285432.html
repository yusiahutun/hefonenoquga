At this point, a bloke on the other side stuck his todger through.</p><p>The girl then supposedly performed a sex act on the bloke. They were allegedly designed in such a way that if a button was pressed by the people on each side then the window between them would turn translucent and each of them would be able to see who was on the other side. She did it at the end... and the the bloke on the side was said to have been her dad!</p><p>Anyone in their right mind felt ill after hearing the mortifying story which was "ripping the family apart" - but thankfully, none of it was real. According to an obviously-vital investigation by <a href=# rel=nofollow>Vice</a>, a reporter went to Amsterdam to conduct an investigation into the city's glory holes and found no evidence of any such place where people could press a button to reveal who was on the other side.</p><p>The publication also claims to called 'every glory hole operator in Amsterdam' and found that most of the venues would turn women away. But those that did let women in said they didn't have a screen with a button.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31284029.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_JS315068827.jpg><p><b id=docs-internal-guid-94a0500d-7fff-cce5-0622-70d0f6c16583><b><i>To stay up to date with all the latest news, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters</i></b> <a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#><b><i><u>here</u></i></b></a> <b><i>.</i></b></b></p><p>But it may be a little late for the people who have already heard the story to recover from hearing it as the incident has already sparked an<a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow> increase of Google searches for 'glory holes'</a> and made<a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow> one dad so paranoid that he felt the need to check his daughters whereabouts before his nightout</a>.
