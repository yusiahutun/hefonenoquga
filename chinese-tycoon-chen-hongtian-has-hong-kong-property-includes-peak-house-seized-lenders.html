Chen bought it through Lambda Industrial – a firm he owns with two others, one of whom is believed to be his wife – for a record HK$2.1 billion in 2016. It was mortgaged twice with BEA in the first half of 2019.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">BEA appointed Deloitte China partners Derek Lai Kar-yan and Ivan Chan Man-hoi as receivers and managers earlier this month, according to sources. In a receivership, the receiver will act primarily in the interest of the creditor who appoints them. This often results in the company being liquidated or dissolved, and may mean that other creditors are not repaid. “We are looking for a buyer for the Gough Hill Road property,” Lai said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lambda Industrial was renamed Chateau 15 Investments. Other directors of the company are Chen Yao Li Ni and Vincent Chen Peng Yu. Yao Li Ni is Chen’s wife, according to Dow Jones’ risk and compliance database.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/30/cf469b0a-521a-4722-83fd-84044d17c7a8_eb2338ba.jpg>In an interview with the Post in June 2016, Chen said he bought 15 Gough Hill Road because an apartment he bought in September 2015 for HK$387 million in Opus Hong Kong in eastern Mid-Levels was <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">“too tiny”</span></a>. The fifth-floor luxury apartment has also been taken over by receivers, said Deloitte’s Lai.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lai and Chan were appointed as receivers of the Opus Hong Kong property, which Chen bought with Yao Li Ni, by Bank of Communications in February this year. The apartment was mortgaged to the bank in August 2019. The receivers are in the process of reviewing the Opus apartment, Lai said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/30/0babc900-d143-43e1-a633-f04801ec9948_cec0c8d0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chen lost control of other assets in the city, including commercial buildings Towers A and B of Cheung Kei Center in Hung Hom. The buildings, previously called One Harbourgate, were bought by Chen through Cheung Kei Center Limited for HK$4.5 billion in December 2016. The other directors of this company are Yao Li Ni and Vincent Chen Peng Yu as well.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They were mortgaged with Hang Seng Bank in May 2019. The bank appointed Christopher So Man-chun and Victor Jong Yat-kit of PwC Hong Kong to take over the buildings this month.</p>Chen had a fortune of 30 billion yuan ranking him 172nd among China’s richest in Hurun Report 2022, the same ranking as <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Hui Ka-yan</span></a>, chairman of embattled developer China Evergrande Group.
