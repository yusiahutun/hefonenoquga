Eldredge shared his unique &#34;best man's speech&#34; to Instagram, and as fans may have guessed by now, he chose to write a special song for his brother's special day, rather than read from a piece of paper."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"My brother is a great man and is my first call when life comes at me sideways. He and his incredibly smart and beautiful wife&nbsp;Lori&nbsp;are gonna have an awesome life together and I couldn’t be more happy for them," Eldredge writes. "I didn’t write&nbsp;[the song] for an album or any project, I wrote it for my brother, and though it’s almost impossible to sing through the tears, hopefully you will at least hear my heart for my brother, my best friend."</p><p>Eldredge is currently on his holiday Glow&nbsp;Live Tour, which will take him to select cities through Dec. 21.</p><p><strong>Brett Eldredge Totally Turned This Fan Surprise Upside Down</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmm6qVqcFuscudqZ6cl5p6o7HSrWSmmZ5iwLC6xmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
