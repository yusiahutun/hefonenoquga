Since then, I’ve been fighting it daily, throwing everything I can at it. Chemo, high dose chemo, medication, transplants, transfusions, surgeries etc. It is called Choriocarcinoma, it is rare, and it has managed to stay many steps ahead of me no matter what I throw at it.”</p><p>“It has taken away half of my hearing, 60pounds of weight, my confidence, and will continue its murderous path until I can manage to stop it somehow and kill it. But it hasn’t taken away my will to survive, or my love of making music. It hasn’t taken me down yet. If you or someone you love is effected (sic) by cancer, please feel free to reach out for it is an emotional rollercoaster unlike anything else.”</p><p>A graduate of Bennington College, Roth released “Python” his debut album in 2018.</p><p>He is survived by his parents, Tim Roth and Nikki Butler, and brother, Hunter Roth.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ39wfY9oampnk6S%2Frq3CZqmorJhiura%2FyJygmqZdlruledOhnGarn6N6sLKMmpqtp6Jiwaq5jKumraBdmbKisIyaq2ZqZWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
