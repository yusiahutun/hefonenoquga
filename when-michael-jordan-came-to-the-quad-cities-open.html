The Quad Cities Open was a struggling golf tournament trying to stay afloat in 1985.
That’s when Michael Jordan came to town. “The celebrity Pro-Am kind of fueled the Quad Cities Open through the early Oakwood years,” said former sportswriter Craig DeVrieze. “There were a lot of famous athletes out on the golf course, mostly famous former athletes."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And this is the only way I can take up some time, so I’ve been out playing golf,” Jordan said.</p><p>A connection to the Western Open in Chicago brought him to the Quad Cities.</p><p>“We were actually his first Pro-Am,” said Jim Epperly, the 1985 Tournament Director. “They personally knew Michael. So Tom [Lenz] put it together with their tournament director, to be in contact with Michael. Then we made that arrangement.”</p><p>DeVrieze covered the tournament for the Moline Dispatch.</p><p>“I’m sure he didn’t know what he was getting into. Moline, Illinois, Coal Valley, Illinois…sure, I’ll take whatever, $15,000, to play a round of golf,” DeVrieze said via Zoom interview. “He’d never played before crowds like that, and he was just intimidated by having galleries lined up along side him.”</p><p>Dozens of autograph seekers met Jordan at the airport. His following became a throng of people by the time he got on the golf course.</p><p>20,000 fans showed up to Oakwood to get a glimpse of the Chicago Bulls star. It would be his only appearance at the Quad Cities Open.</p><p>“He had said he’d be back next year, and then when we were talking to him he said ‘I can’t do it’,” Epperly said. “10 years later when Hardees dropped out, I called and said ‘you made the phone call haven’t you?’. You’ve got to get a hold of Michael. He promised he’d be back.”</p><p>Hardees became the event’s sponsor. Jordan had signed with McDonalds.</p><p>“I think the Classic at that point was more than happy to trade a Wednesday with Michael Jordan for nine years of real title sponsorship,” DeVrieze said. “That ended up being the bridge that ultimately carried them to the John Deere Classic.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfqL2wvtOsZqWnk5a5br%2FPqKmtq1%2Bstaa6jKagnKCRmrluts6rm5qmXZiurrGMraZmrJiaerLBwJ1knKGknrK0ec6pnKdn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
