The FBI actor’s maternal grandparents were Filipino (grandfather) and Mexican (grandmother). Hence, the actor is a Hispanic-American by ethnicity.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Actor, Clayton&nbsp;Cardenas&nbsp; with his father on a dinner date</strong> (Photo: Clayton Cardenas's Instagram)</p><p style=text-align:justify>Even at the age of 33, the actor is very close to his father and mother.
