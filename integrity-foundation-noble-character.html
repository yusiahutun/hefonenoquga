It was also a year that calls for deep reflection. At the beginning of a new year, I wish Hong Kong stability and prosperity. I also wish all young people good health and success in their studies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Two weeks ago I attended a requiem mass for a leading citizen. The church was packed with his friends and relatives. They had all come to mourn the passing of this brilliant barrister. The touching memorial speech portrayed his meaningful life, which was signified by his zest for life and the way he served the community with integrity. As I sat in a corner of the church, his likeness kept flashing across my mind. Many thoughts swirled, and what I pondered over, again and again, was the word ?integrity?.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Integrity means being honest, keeping one?s promises and being consistent in one?s words and deeds. It connotes exemplary conduct and nobility of character. A man of integrity does not tell lies. Both his words and deeds are guided by high moral standards. Cheng Hao, the great thinker of the Song Dynasty, believed that integrity was fundamental to the cultivation of one?s moral character. Zhou Dunyi took the view that honesty was ?the basis of the five cardinal virtues, the origin of all good behaviour?. Indeed, integrity is the foundation of a person?s moral character and a necessary asset for establishing oneself in society.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Whether it is among peers, family and siblings, or between employers and employees, integrity is cherished as the highest moral quality in human relationships. Integrity helps build trust. With mutual trust, there will be genuine and sincere communication, which will avoid unnecessary speculation and help to resolve problems. ?In making friends, one must speak with credibility?, say the Confucian Analects. And, as Shakespeare wrote: ?Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none . . . and keep thy friend under thy own life?s key.? At all times and in all countries, the key to human relationships is integrity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We must also rely on integrity to establish our reputations and careers. We must observe this moral principle every day of our lives. Young people must not think that a small lie will do no harm. We may find it convenient to do so or can get away with it temporarily. But we may have to tell more lies to cover it up. How tiring it will be. In the wise words of Confucius: ?A gentleman has a clear conscience, a man with a crooked mind is always worrying.?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Integrity is also one of the pillars, apart from the law, in maintaining order in a society. To win the trust of the people, people holding public office need to demonstrate a high degree of integrity. Last year, Gallup International, a public opinion research organisation, conducted an unprecedented global survey on ?credibility?, in which citizens in 45 countries were asked to rate their level of trust in a variety of political and social institutions. According to the findings, democratic institutions (including parliaments and congresses) were rated the least trusted, and more than two-thirds of the respondents were of the view that their country was not governed in line with the wishes of the people. As Hong Kong embarks on the progressive development of a democratic political system, these findings are worthy of reflection by people in politics.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Upholding integrity is a personal choice. If we have a clear conscience, no matter how much we may lose out, we must still stand firm and be a person of integrity. ?I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true,? said Abraham Lincoln, a highly respected former president of the United States. ?I am not bound to succeed, but I am bound to live by the light that I have. I must stand with anybody that stands right, and stand with him while he is right, and part with him when he goes wrong.? Let?s make integrity the key moral principle of our lives and the foundation on which we develop a noble character.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdkaX5xfJdooKeslZy%2FqsDYZp2orZ6ZrrW1zqdkp6eSobJur8eaqZqbpJq%2F</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
