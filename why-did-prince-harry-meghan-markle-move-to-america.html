It was reported that she had considered moving abroad to North America in the year following her divorce from Prince Charles, and so Harry may have been influenced by the link to his mother.</p><p id=e_DSMBkx5apF data-wc=97>In November 2019, Diana's former butler Paul Burrell confirmed that she had hoped to spend more time there during an episode of Loose Women. "Diana was also deciding to spend some of her time in America," he explained to the panel. "In fact, the day she died, on her desk were plans of a home in Malibu in California, which she was in the process of purchasing. She was going to take William and Harry for three, four weeks every year to America to give them a different culture, to give them a different insight into life."</p><p id=eFp5IWoSuN0M data-wc=26>In fact, Meghan and Harry have now <a class=hm-link href=#>bought their very first home</a> together in Santa Barbara, just one hour away from Malibu, where Diana had intended on investing in a property.</p><p id=ecyu4WlAL44l data-wc=52>A representative for Harry and Meghan told<strong> HELLO!</strong> that they moved into the family home with son Archie in July, adding, "They have settled into the quiet privacy of their community since their arrival and hope that this will be respected for their neighbours, as well as for them as a family."&nbsp;</p><p id=eHtNGltcRUXk data-wc=23><strong>Make sure you never miss a ROYAL story! <a class=hm-link href=#>Sign up to our newsletter</a> to get all of our celebrity, royal and lifestyle news delivered directly to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbyusdJoaWlqYGWFcn6YbmlucV%2Bstbp5w6KbZqiinruksYyhmKuqqWK6prPHmqVmpZGnuK2xjKamr51dqbxurcyeqaKbkWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
