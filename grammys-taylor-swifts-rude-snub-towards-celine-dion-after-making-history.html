I love Taylor Swift just as much as the next, but that snub to music royalty Celine Dion was so distasteful. Taylor didn’t even make eye contact with Celine when she grabbed the Grammy…gross…,” penned a third.</p><p>However, others rushed to the star’s defense after the overwhelming moment: “Did Taylor Swift disrespect or snub Celine Dion? No. Was she clearly distracted by someone behind her at the exact moment Celine Dion handed her the award? 100000%.”</p><p>In December 2022, the All by Myself singer announced she was <a href=#>diagnosed with stiff-person syndrome</a>, and would be stepping away from performing.</p><p>When entering the stage to a standing ovation, she exclaimed: “Thank you, all! I love you right back. You look beautiful. When I say I’m happy to be here, I really mean it from my heart.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-icons-put-the-rumors-to-bed>The icons put the rumors to bed</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1986706859-1024x683.jpg><p>Despite what social media has been saying, the two music icons put the ‘feud’ rumors to bed as they shared some smiley snaps backstage.</p><p>In one photo, Swift was pictured leaning her head on the 55-year-old, as she placed her arm around her and both smiled for the camera.</p><p>The pair even coordinated with their outfit choices, as they both opted for wrapped fabric dresses with thigh-high cuts.</p><p>Although neither has commented on the ‘interaction’ the pictures say a thousand words, and the ‘feud’ rumors can well and truly be put to bed.</p><p>After an eventful night of two Grammy wins, and announcing her album, Taylor has no time to stop as she’s off to Tokyo before (hopefully) returning to the States to watch <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> and the Kansas City Chiefs <a href=#>in the Super Bowl next weekend</a>.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2WCcLPRmqSmsaNiwaLFy6ipZqunnrO1v4yrrJ2dXai7tq6MraawmaKZwG6vxKWgp51dmbawuoyana2domK6orfIp55moJmowbC%2B2Gg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
