It's likely that dozens of brands of LED strip lights on Amazon use this same generic chipset, which is <a href=#>probably available off-the-shelf</a> in China where they are manufactured.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-if-i-don-t-own-an-led-strip-light>What If I Don't Own an LED Strip Light?</h2><p>The reason why ELK-BLEDOM is such a mystery is because people scanning for Bluetooth devices are seeing nearby strip lights owned by others, most likely their neighbors. In one example, we saw (and connected to) an LED strip light located in a different house over 70 feet away.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is Bluetooth?</a></span></p><p>The "BLE" in the name probably refers to <a href=#>Bluetooth Low Energy</a>, which is a type of <a href=#>Bluetooth</a> designed for low-power devices. But ironically, these LED strip lights seem to have a stronger Bluetooth signal than many other devices because they can often be seen on Bluetooth lists from unusually large distances away. The range of a typical Bluetooth device is generally around 30 feet.</p><h2 id=it-s-not-a-hidden-camera>It's Not a Hidden Camera</h2><p>We've seen <a href=#>rumors online</a> that ELK-BLEDOM might refer to a hidden camera or security camera with Bluetooth capability. After an intensive search, we have not found any manuals or documentation to confirm this. Most likely, the camera rumor emerged as a worry from people who see ELK-BLEDOM and don't have a LED strip light in their household (or they don't know that their LED strip light has Bluetooth capabilities.)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/led_strip_light_example.jpg><p>Even so, you can easily rule out the possibility of a camera by downloading an LED light controller app on your phone, such as duoCo Strip on <a href=#>iPhone</a> or <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Android</a>. When you run it, you'll likely see "BLEDOM" or "ELK-BLEDOM" in the "Group Manage" tab on the side. If so, you know it's a strip light. Furthermore, you might even be able to connect to the strip light device if the signal is strong enough. Amazingly, these LED strip lights don't use any form of wireless security, so if you own one, anyone nearby with the app can control it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Also, if you want to try to pinpoint where the ELK-BLEDOM device is physically located, you can use an app such as Wunderfind (on <a href=#>iPhone</a> or <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Android</a>). To do so, run Wunderfind and walk around the area, and you'll see the distance to ELK-BLEDOM change as you move.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/elk_bledom_distance.jpg><p>Doing this, you can pinpoint the direction and how far away it is---and maybe locate the device if it isn't in someone else's house or apartment next door. Good luck, and stay safe out there!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Best LED Strip Lights of 2023</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhucm5jbINww8eaq2aho2KyrbeMm6OenJ%2BierC6jKawZpqcqrK1u86tn2akmajBcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
