The lyrics depict a flashy and lucrative lifestyle, with references to luxury cars, money, and drugs. However, by analyzing specific standout lyrics, we can uncover imaginative and unexpected themes that add complexity to the song.One standout lyric is "Take the pot slam dunk (skkrr) Shawn Kemp." This line references former NBA player Shawn Kemp, known for his explosive dunks. In the context of the song, this lyric represents the act of successfully completing a drug deal and celebrating the achievement. The theme that emerges from this is the pursuit of success through risky and unconventional means.Another important lyric is "I call the work Moses, it walks cross the water." This line metaphorically compares the drugs being trafficked to Moses parting the Red Sea. This unexpected theme highlights the power and influence that drugs can have in society, as they can effortlessly penetrate barriers and boundaries.The line "Wrappin' it up like aluminum foil, my money tall like a Sequoia" introduces the theme of deception and hidden fortunes. The comparison between drugs being wrapped in aluminum foil and money being stacked tall like a Sequoia tree suggests that wealth is often concealed and disguised. This theme suggests that the drug trade operates under a veil of secrecy and opportunistic deception.Additionally, the lyric "I'm chasing the bread and I'm chasing the crumb" explores the theme of relentless pursuit. In this context, "bread" represents large sums of money, while "crumb" represents smaller profits. The song implies that the characters in the drug trade are on an endless quest for wealth, tirelessly chasing after every opportunity, no matter how small. This theme underscores the insatiable greed that can be associated with this lifestyle.The line "Yo bitch she looking at hundreds of bands on the table, I watch her like cable" introduces the theme of objectification and power dynamics. The reference to the woman as "bitch" and the speaker's possessiveness over her demonstrate a sense of entitlement and disregard for her humanity. The theme here is the objectification of women as mere accessories to the flashy lifestyle portrayed in the song.These imaginative and unexpected themes provide a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the song "Shawn Kemp" by Migos. While the overarching theme revolves around the drug trade and the glamorous lifestyle it can offer, the specific standout lyrics shed light on additional themes such as the pursuit of success, the power dynamics involved, the deception and hidden wealth, the relentless chase for more, and the objectification of women. As listeners, it is important to critically engage with the lyrics of songs like these and explore the underlying narratives and themes they convey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonyutcaoqmillZa7qrrGZqafZaOdrri6jKScpqhdl8Zuucigpqw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
