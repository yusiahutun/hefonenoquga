He is loyal to Wessex, and to both King Alfred (David Dawson) in his time and to Alfred‚Äôs son, King Edward (Timothy Innes). He‚Äôs a fan favorite character that fans truly appreciate.</p><p id=par-4_73>Clerkin recently shared some images on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;on July 2, 2021, from season 4 that fans will want to see. In the first black and white photo, Clerkin is dressed as Father Pyrlig complete with his usual robes and what looks like a sword is leaning on his head as he lays down in the grass on his side. He smiles for the memorable shot. Some people can be seen in the background as well.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-5_41>Next, is another black and white shot of Pyrlig lying back on what looks like a horse.

Rowley, Innes, and Elliot are tagged in the photo.</p><h2 id=h-cavan-clerkin-also-shared-a-video>Cavan Clerkin also shared a video</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-7_86>Finally, we see a black and white video of Clerkin holding a dummy without a head in front of him. He says something in the video without sound, then his hat is gone, and he waves the dummy‚Äôs hand and arm. Next, we see Clerkin alongside what could be Millie Brady dressed as her character Aethelflaed. Each of them holds a dummy without a head and moves around while waving with one of their hands. Clerkin eventually puts his hand down before the video cuts off.</p><p id=par-8_28>Clerkin captioned the post: ‚Äú#fatherpyrlig #thelastkingdom #season4.‚Äù He gives credit to James Northcote, who plays Aldhelm, as the photographer.
