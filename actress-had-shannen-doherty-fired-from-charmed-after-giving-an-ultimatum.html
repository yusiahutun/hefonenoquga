In 2006, it became the longest running hour-long TV series where all leads were female. This feat wasn’t surpassed until Desperate Housewives came onto the scene in 2012. However, one key detail that fans have never been able to get over, is how Shannen Doherty left Charmed after only three seasons.</strong></p><p>Now, one of the lead stars has come forward to claim it was down to a lot of drama behind the scenes. <a href=#>TV</a> star Holly Marie Combs, who played Piper, has come to say Shannen Doherty was fired from Charmed, and that she didn’t leave on her own accord. In a new podcast interview, she sat down opposite the <a href=#>celebrity</a> to explain how she found out what really happened.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shannen-doherty-was-fired-from-charmed-because-of-alyssa-milano>Shannen Doherty was ‘fired’ from Charmed because of Alyssa Milano</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1414599-705x1024.jpg><p>The 50-year-old spoke to fellow Charmed star Shannen Doherty on her <a href=# rel=nofollow>podcast</a>, Let’s Be Clear, this week.</p><p>Talking about the hit Paramount series and finding out Shannen, who played Prue, was no longer part of the cast, she let slip what went down.</p><p>Holly sought out producer Jonathan Levin in the early noughties to ask why Shannen was given the boot.</p><p>She explained: “He said, ‘We didn’t mean to — but we’ve been backed into this corner — we’re basically in this position where it’s one or the other.</p><p>“We were told [by Alyssa] it’s her or [Shannen] and Alyssa has threatened to sue us for a hostile workplace environment.’”</p><p>Holly was on the show between 1998 and 2006, said there was friction between three <a href=#>Hollywood</a> stars. But she claims it wasn’t picked up by the rest of the crew or guest stars on certain episodes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-i-didn-t-want-to-go-on-without-her>‘I didn’t want to go on without her’</h2><p>At the time of her shock exit, Holly went as far as considering leaving herself. She even apparently told producer Jonathan about her thoughts on walking away because Shannen had been let go from the Charmed cast.</p><p>“This is not a show I wanted to do without Shannen. She didn’t want to do it without me. Therefore, I don’t want to do it without her and that should be fairly clear,” she remembered saying.</p><p>After Shannen left the series, she was replaced by Rose McGowan. Her character was killed off at the end of season 3, back in 2001.</p><p>But the actress, who has been fighting stage four breast cancer for eight years, also spoke out about the ordeal.</p><p>“As you get older, you accept that a situation happened. Acceptance and moving on with your life does not equate to forgiveness,” she explained.</p><p>“You just learn a lesson and look at somebody differently and move on.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-alyssa-milano-s-cryptic-post>Alyssa Milano’s cryptic post</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Today is my birthday!
