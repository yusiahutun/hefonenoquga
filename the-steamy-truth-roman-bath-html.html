Peer more closely, however, and acres of plump, naked flesh glow pink in the half-light.</p><p>In one corner, a bored-looking prostitute straddles a drunken guard. In another, a dozen soldiers break into song, before plunging naked into the marble pool.</p><p>Men and women wrestle, writhe, fornicate and philosophise in the pool while, at the water's edge, a small army peddles sausages, oysters and roasted dormice.</p><p>This, according to historians, was a typical Roman scene in the genteel city of Bath. In their heyday, the hot springs at Aquae Sulis — where a million litres of hot spring water burst each day from red-stained holes in the stone walls — attracted hordes of visitors, including emperors, soldiers, housewives, prostitutes and children.</p><p>The scene is very different today. While the Roman baths still remain as a historical exhibit, visitors are forbidden from taking to the waters. Instead, attention is focused on a new building across the road.</p><p>For ten years, an attempt has been under way to construct new baths, with real spa treatments for visitors, introducing them to some, if not all, of the Romans' favourite pastimes.</p><p>The plan has been beset by the sort of infighting, deceit and power struggles that would have made the Romans proud. There have been 12 missed opening dates, and costs have shot up from a predicted £13.5million — including an £8 million grant from the Millennium Commission — to £45 million, according to incensed Labour MP Dan Norris.</p><p>But on Monday, Bath's Roman spa will finally re-open for business. So can the spirit of reckless indulgence that attracted so many people in the past be revived?</p><p>Founded in AD 43, after the invasion of Britain by Emperor F Claudius, Aquae Sulis was dedicated to Minerva, the Roman goddess of war, wisdom and crafts. According to Peter Jones, a classics scholar and writer, it was open to anyone who could afford the negligible entrance fee.</p><p>'Baths were dirt cheap and the focus of social get-togethers both for the great and good and the poor and dissolute,' he says. 'They catered for almost everything: swimming, exercise, shopping, eating, reading, boozing, philosophy, beauty treatments and, most importantly, sex.</p><p>'Intercourse was commonplace — either with women, young boys or slaves. Sometimes it was in the water, but often the baths were a sort of foreplay or, often, a five or six play. They were a bit like naked leisure centres, with a sordid twist.'</p><a rel href=# class=lightboxPopupLink onclick=return!1><span class=clickToEnlargeTop>Enlarge</span> <span class=clickToEnlarge></span> <span class=clickToEnlargeButton>&nbsp;</span> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2006/08/pool040806_100x110.jpg height=110 width=100 alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p>Beauty treatments were also wildly popular and just as odd-sounding as those on offer today.</p><p>Men's armpits, backs, chests and genitals were stripped of hair by expert pluckers. Bodies were smothered in oil and scraped with strips of wood or bone, and massages were common, although the wealthy would usually bring their favourite slave to do the honours.</p><p>With their skin pink and crinkly from the water, and libidos sated, Romans would head to the gym, library, restaurants, shops, lounges, taverns, museums or theatres.</p><p>While Roman baths represented extreme hedonism (ancient graffiti on the walls in Latin read: 'Baths, drink and sex corrupt our bodies, but baths, drink and sex make life worth living'), they were also the summit of civil engineering.</p><p>Commissioned and paid for by emperors and benefactors, they had underfloor heating, saunas, steam rooms, hot and cold pools, and specially filtered water. They were built to exacting standards by skilled slaves on time and within budget.</p><p>Around AD 410, however, the Romans began to withdraw from Britain to concentrate on defending Rome against barbarians, and the baths fell into ruin.</p><p>When, two centuries later, Bath was conquered by the Saxons, the spa was swallowed by a swamp.</p><p>It was rediscovered only in 1790, during the great revival of the city, when foundations were dug for a new kind of healing spa. Visitors included everyone from Jane Austen to Napoleon.</p><p>This closed in the 1970s, due to a health scare when a woman contracted Legionnaires' disease after bathing in the hot spring water.</p><p>But as the tourists tailed off, many Bath residents continued to believe that the city's fortunes were linked to those of the baths. So it seemed a good idea, a decade ago, to revive them once more.</p><p>A building would be constructed 100yards from the original Roman spa. It would be a gleaming vision of glass, steel and honey-coloured stone, with sunken lighting, white Kashmir granite floors and Italian plate-glass windows.</p><p>Work began, supported by the Millennium Commission. But in April 1999, a pair of mallards laid six eggs on the site. Building work was delayed by 18 months.</p><p>The baths have since suffered a stream of expensive disasters. Contractors drilled the wrong bore hole to access the waters. A month was lost when cranes were damaged by high winds. Cobbles outside the spa were laid incorrectly and had to be pulled up.</p><p>And, last February, costs reportedly soared by another £700,000 when all 274 windows needed replacing, apparently due to vandalism and subsidence.</p><p>Meanwhile, the steam-room floor started leaking, the original water filtration system had to be replaced at a cost of £91,000 and the spa's pride and joy — a rippling, aquamarine, open-air rooftop pool, with stainless steel fixtures buffed to a gleaming shine with Johnson's Baby Oil — filled up with seagull excrement.</p><p>In August 2003, however, faces were at their reddest. Three days before Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo jetted in to open the baths, there was another catastrophe.</p><p>Peter Rollins, sales and marketing manager for Dutch operator the Thermae Development company, recalls: 'Everything was perfect.</p><p>'The baths were full, the waters were bubbling away, we had 60 staff trained and ready to go, the place looked wonderful and the Three Tenors were on their way. Then someone noticed the waterproof paint was flaking off,' he whispers. 'It was devastating, absolutely devastating.'</p><p>Too late and too sheepish to cancel, organisers hastily changed the event from 'an opening' to a 'revival' of the spa and as soon as the tenors had dipped their chubby toes in the water, pulled the plug.</p><p>The unexpected costs have left the council, which has guaranteed the project, with a nearly £40million bill. No wonder Norris calls it 'the Daddy of all overspends — a glorified swimming pool that most can't afford to visit'.</p><p>At full capacity, the complex will hold just 250 visitors, each of whom will have to pay £19 for two hours and £45 for a full day to enjoy the main complex. Treatments — ranging from £38 for an alarming-sounding Alpine hay bath to £135 for a caviar-and-pearl facial — are extra.</p><p>Even the £6 discount for residents to the tiny Cross Bath is unlikely to soothe ruffled feathers. 'It is incompetence on a magnificent scale,' rages Norris. 'Put it this way — if you buy a Mini and it ends up costing a million, it's never going to be good value, however hard you flog it.'</p><p>I'm not so sure. The New Royal Bath is an exceptionally beautiful building in a stunning setting. The waters shimmer invitingly and the marriage between Georgian, Roman and 21st-century architecture is a great success.</p><p>The Romans would doubtless have been appalled at the costly mess. Yet, as Rollins puts it: 'I'm sure there were hiccups back then, but it would have been a lot easier.</p><p>'After all, if the slaves got things wrong, their masters could just lop a few heads off. If only things had been as simple in Bath today.'</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWKAeoWPam5ojJiaerTAxJqksmWkp8K1tIyLpqaZnmKPosDHZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
