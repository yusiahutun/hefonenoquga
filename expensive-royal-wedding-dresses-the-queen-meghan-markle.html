The Queen even collected coupons to pay for her dress!</p><p id=etxyhYeLAm8R data-wc=38>It was created by Norman Hartnell using Chinese silk, and shaped with a high neckline, tailored bodice and a 15-foot long train. Pearl and diamante-encrusted star flowers, roses, jasmine blossoms and wheat adorned the bodice and the skirt.</p><p id=erv_HfZG6ga3 data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Why Prince Philip's sisters didn't attend his wedding to the Queen</a></strong></p><p id=eoGY5r_tFaH7 data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a aria-label="Pippa Middleton's huge £250k engagement ring has rare royal link" class=hm-link href=#>Pippa Middleton's huge £250k engagement ring has rare royal link</a></strong></p><h2>6.

Lindka Cierach created the style, with precise beadwork incorporating various symbols including anchors and waves representing Prince Andrew's sailing background.</p><p id=etgfA9PjRu2P data-wc=64>Her 17-foot long train was embroidered with the initials A and S in silver beads. Sarah spoke out about her dress in her 1997 memoir My Story, describing it as, "an exquisite creation I'd lost twenty-six pounds to fit into. Lindka was a genius; I knew she could make the most flattering gown ever, and she had. It was amazingly boned, like a corset."</p><h2>5.

She worked closely with the duo to create a number of meaningful motifs including a Thistle for Scotland as a reference to the couple's <a class=hm-link href=#>love for Balmoral</a>, a Shamrock for Ireland as a nod to the bride's heritage and the York Rose and ivy representing the couple's home.</p><p id=eaWB7BwluNVH data-wc=17>She also opted for a low back that&nbsp;would display a scar she had from scoliosis surgery.</p><h2>2.
