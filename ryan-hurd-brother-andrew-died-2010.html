"I’ve watched my Mom and my Dad have to learn how to live after losing a child. I’ve seen my brother and especially my little sister grow up and become exceptional people in the face of unspeakable grief."</p><p><a href=#>News reports</a> from 2010 indicate Andrew lost his life in a two-car accident that occurred as he was heading home from soccer practice at his Kansas high school. Hurd reflects on how much he would have loved for his <a href=#>wife</a> and fellow country star <a href=#>Maren Morris</a> to have met Andrew.</p><p>"I wish Maren could have gotten to know that part of me that we can only talk about now, but mostly we just miss him,"&nbsp;the "Diamonds or Twine"&nbsp;singer says. "Nothing can ever make it ok, but we are all so proud that we got to know him, and if you are living with loss right now, I hope that you read this like it’s a giant hug from the Hurds just for you."</p><p><strong>13 Country Stars Who Died Too Young:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmq7GRo3qpwdGdZJuqn6m1pr6MmqWdqpWseqW1xJ1ka2hhZXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
