One former stalker fan revealed that this is an eerily popular tactic because “the members are so vulnerable” and “can’t escape” while on a plane.</p><p id=par-4_33>The stalker fans also invade BTS’s privacy in other ways, such as visiting hotel rooms where the members are staying, getting their personal contact information, and trying to physically touch them without permission.</p><p id=par-5_33>The BTS members have addressed this ongoing problem of stalker fans. In a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">live stream</a> in December 2019, V shared how <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“scary”</a> it is for BTS to encounter fans who invade their privacy.</p><p id=par-6_52>“You know how nowadays we board planes by ourselves? We fly on private flights [now],” he said. “We want to fly on commercial flights, but whenever we travel long distance or short distance, there are people who know about our flights and will sit in front of or right next to us.”</p><h2 id=h-jungkook-once-talked-about-stalker-fans-trying-to-call-him>Jungkook once talked about stalker fans trying to call him</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_30>Some stalker fans even get a hold of the members’ phone numbers and call them. However, BTS seems to be aware of this activity and most likely would not respond.</p><p id=par-8_33>In June 2019,&nbsp;Jungkook&nbsp;received a call when he was in the middle of a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">live stream</a>. Jungkook quickly blocked the number and shared that he does not answer calls from numbers he does not recognize.</p><p id=par-9_30>“If someone is calling to see if it’s my phone number, I immediately block that number,” he said. “Stalker fans call me a lot, so I have to block them.”</p><h2 id=h-bts-has-some-tricks-they-use-to-go-outside-in-peace>BTS has some tricks they use to go outside in peace</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-10_17>Being world-famous celebrities, it’s no secret that the BTS members often has trouble going outside in peace.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_46>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>, BTS revealed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">some tricks</a> they employ to go undetected. For example, RM shared that, because they are “seven boys with dyed hair,” they can attract a lot of attention from people, so they often leave their accommodations in small groups.</p><p id=par-12_39>If they want to go to a movie theater, BTS take advantage of either the earliest or latest showing of the day to avoid crowds. They also utilize the internet to shop online instead of going to physical stores.</p><p id=par-13_42>However, if fans do end up seeing BTS out and about, some members are okay with fans openly recognizing them. Jungkook revealed that he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sometimes goes to karaoke rooms</a> to practice his singing and fans can say hi if they see him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvtb%2FSZqGuppegvLC3jKilnJ1dqa6tt8SdZJqan6rBbrPErauippdivam7zZ5knJmcocBustGopGarpJa5rLHRZp2apqNjtbW5y2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
