After quitting her career as a publicist, she opted to join her mother in activism.</p><p class=align-left>Through her mother, Emily is a Native American who traces her ancestry back to the Ho-Chunk tribe. She is more aggressive in fighting for her people. The Ho-Chunk people from the Siouan group are natives of the present-day states Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois and Iowa.</p><p class=align-left>The Ho-Chunk tribe has been in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">long-standing battle</a> with the United States government and other states' organisations. The major cause of this beef has been their land which was stripped away from them in 2017.</p><p class=align-left>For more than 30 years now, Emily's mother has been at the forefront of fighting for her people. She once held the position of director for the Ho-Chunk Tribe of Wisconsin's Research Committee. Luckily, her daughter has also joined to fight for their land and preserve their Siouan language.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9f4410d7ebb96694.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Vanessa Kingori: The story of Kenyan-born British Vogue Publishing Director</span></p></a><h3>Her husband is a writer, actor, activist and TV personality</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/10422624a03e7135.jpeg><p class=align-left>Emily is the wife of Gavin Miles Mclnnes.

Afterwards, he tried his luck in the film industry while still nurturing his career as a television personality. He once appeared as a judge on <i>Kenny vs Spenny</i> and several short films and animated cartoons.</p><h3>Emily Jendrisak is not active on social media</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/206a76df1ee6fd43.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Marie Pierre Bouchard: quick facts about the Just For Laughs star</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Unlike many celebrities who fancy social media, she prefers to live her life away from the limelight. Emily Jendrisak Instagram is not active. She prefers to live a quiet life away from the public's eyes.</p><p class=align-left>Recently, his husband, Gavin Miles, was faced with some issues with the different social media platforms that led him to be banned from Facebook and Twitter for violating the terms-of-service. Gavin wrote a statement in regret of the occurrence, saying the following.</p>I do bear responsibility. I'm not guilt-free in this. There's culpability there. I shouldn't have said, you know, violence solves everything or something like that without making the context clear, and I regret saying things like that.<p class=align-left>This could be another reason the activist stays away from social media, as it is said that the internet does not forget. She experienced her husband<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> de-platformation </a>first hand. The former publicist also offered some remarks in regards to this occurrence.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5096cf2739922ea2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Anna Beth Goodman: What you need to know about John Goodman's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>She seemed happier that her husband was no longer on social media.

She has made some significant sum of money from being a publicist. Emily Jendrisak <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a> stands at $1 million as of 2021.</p><p class=align-left>Apart from her career, the former publicist also enjoys her husband's wealth which is estimated to stand at $10 million. Her husband makes huge sums of money from his various income streams. However, the FreeTalk platform is his main source of income.</p><p class=align-left>He is proof that being downright honest, controversial, provocatively rebellious, and even to the point of offensively crass can generate a significant following in the US amongst anti-social people today. Subsequently, one gets to reap huge benefits from it, and Emily and Gavin are enjoying this.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a6e91818795d8ee1.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Victoria Granucci: The untold story of John Mellencamp's ex-wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Emily Jendrisak is an accomplished American activist and former publicist.
