It's an elegant solution for folks who need access to files on multiple devices or if several people in the same building want to store data in a centralized location.</p><p>After <a href=#>selecting a NAS station</a> that will house all your NAS hard drives, you'll be faced with your next big decision—which hard drives are right for you?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first thing you'll need to determine is how much capacity you need. This refers to the amount of storage available on the hard drive. Most homes should be perfectly served by 1TB or 2TB hard drives, but if you're a power user, you might want to invest in something larger.</p><p>If you're regularly working with sizable projects or in a creative capacity requiring hefty image and video files, consider springing for a larger hard drive.</p><p>Capacity isn't the only thing to worry about. You'll also need to consider something known as <a href=#>workload rate</a>. This is the amount of data you can transfer to and from the hard drive without impacting its reliability. In other words, some hard drives are designed to withstand a lot of data transfer, while others aren't quite up to the task.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The exact definition of workload rate tends to vary by manufacturer. But if you and your fellow network users are constantly uploading and downloading data from your NAS, then the workload rate is something to keep a close eye on.</p><p>When it comes to the best NAS hard drives, it's hard to beat Western Digital and Seagate. The two companies are undoubtedly the best in the business, and we recommend sticking with their catalogs.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><td colspan=3 style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p><strong>How Did We Research</strong></p></td></tr><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Models Evaluated</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Hours Researched</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Reviews Analyzed</p></td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>11</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>5</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>16</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>How-To Geek's product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

It's also designed specifically for intense users who need their files accessible 365 days a year at all hours. It also includes three years of Rescue Data Recovery Services if anything happens to go awry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The biggest downside to the IronWolf Pro is its 300TB/year workload rate. It's not necessarily bad (300TB/year is a middle-of-the-pack stat), but if you're a power user who transfers buckets of data annually, you might come up against those limitations. It's a minor gripe on an otherwise stellar product, and most NAS systems will be served well by adding the IronWolf Pro to its bays.</p><p>Speaking of bays, the IronWolf Pro supports up to 24-bay NAS systems, making this a great option for enterprise-level systems and personal users who need incredible performance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/seagate-ironwold-nas-18tb.jpg> <img data-field=badge-image src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h5 class=display-card-title>Seagate IronWolf Pro 8TB NAS</h5><span>Best NAS Hard Drive Overall</span><p class=display-card-description>A great combination of pricing and performance, the Seagate IronWolf Pro is a great option for most users—unless you require a lofty workload rate.</p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">$199 at Amazon</a><h2 id=best-value-nas-hard-drive-western-digital-red-plus-8tb-nas>Best Value NAS Hard Drive: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Western Digital Red Plus 8TB NAS</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpressstatic0.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-howtogeek-best_of-generic.png><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th><p>Pros</p></th><th><p>Cons</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Affordable</p></td><td><p>180TB/year workload rate</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Multiple available capacities</p></td><td><p>Slower than other options on this list</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Works with up to eight-bay NAS systems</p></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're looking for a great NAS hard drive that won't break the bank (but won't fail when you need it most), you'll want to look closely at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Western Digital Red Plus NAS</a> hard drive. You'll find it offered in various capacities, but the 8TB model should be more than enough for personal use. Better yet, it comes in at around $160, which is an exceptional price.</p><p>Considering that low price point, you're getting some great functionality. This includes support for up to eight bays, hardware designed to run 24/7, and a three-year limited warranty to put your mind at ease. You can also find a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">14TB</a> version if you need heaps of storage.</p><p>Unfortunately, that $160 price tag for the 8TB model has some limitations. For one, it only offers a 180TB/year workload rate. This should be enough for personal setups with only a few connected users. But if you're purchasing a hard drive for your small businesses or need to move large piles of data, you should maybe look elsewhere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shortcomings aside, few NAS options in this price range match this hard drive's performance.

It also comes with the usual IronWolf Health Management System, giving you an easy way to monitor the drive and ensure all your data is secure.</p><p>The 180MB/s transfer speeds aren't the fastest in the business, but they're impressive considering the overall price of the package.

It can get a bit noisy when running at full capacity.
