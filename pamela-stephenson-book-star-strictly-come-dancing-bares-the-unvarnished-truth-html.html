I remember feeling guilty about the wicked delight I felt when the rogue leading my mother’s camel threatened: ‘Pay me more, lady, or I’ll make the camel dance!’</span></p><p><span>Later I watched gleefully as she bounced around like a rag doll on&nbsp; a mechanical bull, wailing. The thought of it still makes me smile – is that&nbsp; so wrong?</span></p><p><span>My father was a zoologist, my mother a biologist and, after they produced three girls, we moved from New Zealand, where I was born, to Sydney, where they took up lecturing positions.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/08/article-2200221-038074210000044D-344_634x884.jpg height=884 width=634 alt="Brains and beauty: Pamela Stephenson in 1977, shortly after she arrived in London" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Brains and beauty: Pamela Stephenson in 1977, shortly after she arrived in London</p><p><span>We moved to a small, arid, inland suburb called Boronia Park where we’d bought an ugly, concrete-sprayed house – have you ever seen that kind of exterior work? It’s hideous, like construction acne, and if you accidentally brush against it, it grazes your skin.</span></p><p><span>The whole area was just developing and I remember it as terribly hot and dusty. There was very little growing there, just a few stringy-barked gum trees and&nbsp; indigenous shrubs.</span></p><p><span>The aural landscape was lively and loud, though; the strident humming of cicadas morning and night, the constant barking of neighbourhood dogs, and a kookaburra laughing from its usual perch on top of our clothes line.</span></p><p><span>Did I mention I didn’t much like my mother? My mother always seemed miserable. Now I realise she must have suffered from depression, and she was also highly anxious. She knew she had poor mothering skills (she apologised to me about that a couple of years before she died).</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/08/article-2200221-14D54F57000005DC-518_634x598.jpg height=598 width=634 alt="Early days: A young Pamela gets a marine biology lesson from her father on the beach at Coromandel, New Zealand" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Early days: A young Pamela gets a marine biology lesson from her father on the beach at Coromandel, New Zealand</p><p><span>To be honest, I always felt she didn’t really like me. And the pervasive envy, bitterness and dismissiveness I felt from her – especially during my teenage years – constituted a painful trauma I have only recently come to understand. It spurred a deep sense of unworthiness, guilt and fury that continues to plague me from time to time.</span></p><p><span>My parents told me once that I was ‘an experiment’. B******s. I was always afraid to ask just how far that went. Did they deliberately deprive me of love and comfort to see how I’d turn out?<br></span></p><p><span>They had huge expectations of me, partly because some clipboard-wielding IQ tester had turned up at my kindergarten and pronounced that I was way too smart for Plasticine and snap (I could read when I was three).</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/08/article-2200221-14D547EA000005DC-600_306x517.jpg height=517 width=306 alt="Water babe: A teenage Pamela sits on the rocks on the sea front in Takapuna, New Zealand in 1964" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Water babe: A teenage Pamela sits on the rocks on the sea front in Takapuna, New Zealand in 1964</p><p><span>I was whisked off to a more advanced classroom where all the kids were talking about dating and periods, which meant that, at seven, I was a social outcast.</span></p><p><span>And even though I was still near the top of my class, my father made it clear that second place was unacceptable.</span></p><p><span>Yeah, I was an experiment, all right; a miserable baby-monster whose classmates didn’t understand that my savage competitive streak was solely in the interests of receiving what every child deserves no matter what their exam results might be – appreciation.</span></p><p><span>I remember burying my head in my lap to try to block out the entire class chanting ‘Teacher’s pet. Teacher’s pet! Teacher’s pet! TEACHER’S PET!’</span></p><p><span>Thank God that resilience never left me, despite the punishment I took – and not just for my braininess. I was just never liked...</span></p><p><span>My hormones were circulating like mad and, at 16, I discovered the thrill of sneaking out at night.<br></span></p><p><span>At first I met up with fellow teenage folk singers and sat in a local park strumming for hours, but eventually I found my way to older, more exciting – and dangerous – men.</span></p><p><span>I would hitchhike into wicked King’s Cross, the centre of Sydney’s well-established ‘vice ring’, and wander around attracting people who did not have my best interests at heart.</span></p><p><span>Now I understand that the adrenaline rush was helping to mitigate my depression; if only someone had noticed how troubled I was. My parents expressed some suspicions about my behaviour, but they never confronted me. I imagine they would have found it hard to believe what I was doing.</span></p><p><span>I blossomed into a slim, peroxide-blonde babe with the deep tan all my friends at Sydney Church of England Girls’ Grammar School aspired to.</span></p><p><span>‘You look quite negroid,’ said my mother when she saw me sunning myself in the back garden. ‘It’s most unattractive.’</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/08/article-2200221-14D54A5C000005DC-330_634x848.jpg height=848 width=634 alt="Comic edge: The Not The Nine O'Clock News team (from left to right) Griff Rhys Jones, Rowan Atkinson and Mel Smith" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Comic edge: The Not The Nine O'Clock News team (from left to right) Griff Rhys Jones, Rowan Atkinson and Mel Smith</p><p><span>I suppose her early days as a white colonial child, the daughter of Methodist missionaries in Fiji, had instilled deep prejudice. I liked to wear my naturally wavy hair straight, but we did not have hair straighteners in those days, so I managed to contort my body to lay my hair on an ironing board, cover it with a cloth, and steam it with the iron.</span></p><p><span>But my breasts were not co-operating; they remained small and bud-like. I stuffed my bikini top with rolled-up school socks, but going in the surf with such poorly improvised augmentation led to an excessive amount of water-retention, shape-distortion and subsequent embarrassment.</span></p><p><span>I was still a virgin at this point. I was fairly ignorant about sex, but I had an inkling that it might be the route to my desired destruction, so when I met a 35-year-old heroin junkie who lured me into his flat, I put up little resistance.</span></p><p style=font-weight:700;color:#c562a5><span>The chaps disliked me... I just wasn't one of them</span></p>&nbsp;<p><span>It was a horrible, painful experience, out of which I got nothing but glandular fever and gonorrhoea. I suppose it was rape. What was the age of consent back then? I don’t even know.</span></p><p><span>I don’t want to know. It was just terrible, but I thought I deserved it, and worse. I told no one, but when I became dreadfully ill our family doctor informed my parents of the truth about my ailments. I gave no excuse. My father came to me as I lay sick in bed.</span></p><p><span>‘You were supposed to keep yourself clean until marriage,’ he said, with such cold fury I could barely take it in. ‘You are no longer my daughter.’</span></p><p><span>Without further discussion, my parents kicked me out of the house. I remember the feeling well, because I still experience it every time someone rejects me, even in some relatively small way.</span></p><p><span>Forgiveness doesn’t come easy, but now, for the first time in my life, I may be ready. I’ve tried many times before. In 2003 I knelt in the graveyard in Russell, New Zealand, where my parents’ ashes were interred. ‘For God’s sake, Pamela,’ I harangued myself, ‘let it go. Just let it go!’ But I couldn’t.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/08/article-2200221-14E85190000005DC-705_306x477.jpg height=477 width=306 alt="In a whirl: Pamela and her partner James Jordan on Strictly Come Dancing in 2010" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>In a whirl: Pamela and her partner James Jordan on Strictly Come Dancing in 2010</p><p><span>More work was required. The first step was to risk connecting viscerally with my deep rage. And now that I have fully felt the pain of that rage – its white-hot heat – I may at last be ready to cool off.<br></span></p><p><span>Oh, please let that be true.&nbsp; I grew up feeling deeply insecure and unworthy, and I sought validation from others. It is a precarious and futile way to live life, and it can only lead to further profound disappointment.</span></p><p><span>Most people I met in London when I arrived in 1978 did not understand that, after my training at Australia’s National Institute of Dramatic Art and my work in Australian theatre, television and film, I was pretty experienced. I felt I was rather accomplished. But I wasn’t good at proving it.</span></p><p><span>I was offered a few modelling jobs, but that was not what I desired. I appeared in a few commercials and took guest roles in some popular TV series, but for someone who had proved herself in serious roles it was a bit embarrassing to play the girl with a grenade down her bra in The Professionals.</span></p><p><span>By 1979 when I was 29, my confidence was growing. I was getting more used to London, and came to understand a bit more about how things worked. I stumbled into my role in Not The Nine O’Clock News, a TV show developed at the BBC by a gang of Oxbridge blokes.</span></p><p><span>It’s quite true that I met the boyish, ebullient and clever producer John Lloyd at a party, but I didn’t sleep with him (as many people thought). No one could understand why a brash Australian Sheila got such a big break in British television, and unkindly assumed it was for the wrong reasons.</span></p><p><span>The show quickly became popular. Looking back, it was quite clever of them to choose me, because a nice British girl might have been afraid to do some of the things I did –&nbsp; taking on icons such as the newsreader Angela Rippon, for example. But I had no idea who anyone was, so I wasn’t afraid.</span></p><p><span>On the very first day’s shoot I simply could not get my lines right (later, John told me he thought he’d made a terrible mistake. I was lucky he didn’t fire me on the spot). But I quickly got into my stride.</span></p><p><span>There was a sketch in which I played a weird animal-rights campaigner who barged into restaurants to ‘rescue’ cooked chickens and perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and after one long, largely improvised scene, our director called ‘Cut!’ and I suddenly became aware that the crew was applauding. ‘OK, I can do this,’ I thought happily. ‘I may not have gone to Oxford, but I’m ready.’</span><br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/08/article-2200221-0C9C5FFC000005DC-943_634x799.jpg height=799 width=634 alt="Instant attraction: Pamela with her husband, comedian Billy Connolly, who she has been married to for more than 30 years" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Instant attraction: Pamela with her husband, comedian Billy Connolly, who she has been married to for more than 30 years</p><p><span>To be honest, I don’t think any of my fellow cast members liked me at all. And I don’t blame them. In fact, I appreciate how benevolently they tolerated my prickliness. In NTNON I tended to steal the limelight by being sexually provocative (the sketches sometimes demanded that).<br></span></p><p><span>Although I privately saw myself as a toothy, short-waisted, pear-shaped munchkin with an unfortunate facial profile, I realised that, with the right make-up, hair and lighting, my looks got me a lot of attention.</span></p><p><span>And I made the mistake of behaving competitively. I really hadn’t learned how to get on with men who weren’t my boyfriends. Yes, the chaps disliked me. I wasn’t ‘one of them’, we were never friends, and we have not kept in touch. Also, I discovered after a couple of series that I was paid a lot less than them. That seriously p****d me off.</span></p><p><span>I’d like to say I played every female role, but in typical British style the boys also loved to get into a dress whenever possible. At the time I found it annoying and I just didn’t get it.</span><br></p><p style=font-weight:700;color:#c562a5><span>Billy was a gipsy lover - with a voice like gravel and honey</span></p>&nbsp;<p><span>The boys and John tended to look slightly guilty whenever they were working on a drag sketch – well, they would,&nbsp; wouldn’t they, with me pouting furiously in the corner? They were all collapsing with mirth, while I made no attempt to conceal my pique.</span></p><p><span>To be honest, I think they could be forgiven for deciding that, off-screen, I had no sense of humour. I remember being very thin at the time, and very edgy.</span></p><p><span>I chain-smoked and ate pure food: no salt, sugar or fat. I wish I could have just lightened up and enjoyed myself, but I couldn’t. I did feel such a misfit.</span></p><p><span>One day I became aware that the NTNON cast and producers were particularly excited because they had an appointment to meet a Scottish comedian called Billy Connolly, who they wanted as a guest on the show.</span></p><p><span>I’d never heard of Billy, but I dutifully went along with the gang to meet him at his manager’s office. We all shook hands with this hairy stranger, then walked round to Geales fish restaurant for lunch.</span></p><p><span>I was shocked. You know how sometimes you meet someone and have a completely unexpected reaction, a kind of secret knowledge?</span></p><a rel href=# class=lightboxPopupLink onclick=return!1><span class=clickToEnlargeTop>Enlarge</span> <span class=clickToEnlarge></span> <span class=clickToEnlargeButton>&nbsp;</span> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/08/article-2200221-14E92EE5000005DC-469_634x156.jpg height=156 width=634 alt="The night Diana and I were 'strip-o-gram' girls" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p><span>Some people would call it ‘love at first sight’ and I suppose it was. I was extremely taken with him.</span></p><p><span>He was so different from the men I had met during NTNON – well-educated, genteel males without that edge of danger that Billy had.</span></p><p><span>I was (unknowingly) strongly attracted to him. At lunch he ate his fish with his bare hands and I remember thinking: ‘What an animal!’<br></span></p><p><span>He was thrilling; a savage gipsy lover with a voice like gravel and honey, but I learned he was married. Oh yes, that’s right – so was I.</span></p><p><span>I had been married to the actor Nicholas Ball for about a year. He was a delightful man whom I truly loved, but we were not quite right for each other and things were getting pretty tense at home.</span></p><p><span>I had met him when he was the star of a TV detective series called Hazell and was enormously taken by him. We got on well for a while, but my sudden success in NTNON eventually meant I was unable to give him the time and focus he deserved.</span></p><p><span>I didn’t see Billy again for about a year after that first meeting, and by then both our marriages were ending so we had the opportunity to be together... I couldn’t possibly have known that, 30-odd years later, we’d be having Christmas dinner with our children and grandchildren.</span></p><p><span><span style=font-weight:700>NEXT WEEK: Bulimia, my unusual husband Billy - and our amazing children</span><br></span></p><p style=font-style:italic;font-weight:700><span>© Pamela Stephenson 2012.

It’s not the same as breaking a fingernail. Reparation involves surgery, cash and some hard-core narcotics.</span></p><p><span>The tragedy occurred in&nbsp; a jive club near Madison Square Garden in New York. I’ve continued to enjoy social dancing since appearing on Strictly Come Dancing in 2010. My partner led me into a crazy lift: the Death Drop.</span></p><p><span>I miscalculated the first part and my right breast hit the deck. I was unaware of the deflation until the next morning when I realised I had one melon and one fried egg.</span></p><p><span>One of the ugliest things about me is that I’m as vain as vain can be and would sell my soul to the devil to be a babe for ever. I first had my bosom enlarged aged 21.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>The surgeon who worked on me in the past had retired, so ‘Dr Bev Hills’ was my knight in shining armour – and also my harshest critic.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>‘Well, I can perk up that right puppy but, in any case, you’re about due for a bit more tweaking, aren’t you? And you lost weight too quickly on that dance programme – your skin’s sagging. Shall we take care of everything at once?’&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It took me just one month to start regretting my surgical choices. Three days after Christmas, I flew to Brazil. I was stupid to travel so soon after surgery and I was gaga on painkillers and antibiotics. </span><span><br></span></p><p><span>But I later headed for the beach – where an epiphany awaited me. Women of all shapes were sunning themselves in the tiniest bikinis – ‘fio dental’ the Brazilians call them, slang for thongs as skinny as dental floss.</span></p><p><span>I watched women at an open-air Zumba-style class. Their cellulite shook rhythmically and their tummies flopped. And they were so comfortable with their bodies, they put me to shame.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>If only I’d come to Brazil two months earlier. With the money I spent on surgery I could have bought a flat. And a wardrobe of fio dentals!</span><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn6RaWdramFknaK5xKWYZoukmr2psc2spqdlkqS8rHmyrZirZYOpv6qv06WwZnuforJukMCnmqKml2Kvor7ErGSNoJVioq%2FCwKuloquYmrFuoNGuq6FmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
