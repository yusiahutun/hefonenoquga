"It's a fascinating place to be as a human being. You're faced with time."</p><p>"When I was 22, I didn't work for three years, deliberately," she added. "And then just about ten years ago, when I started my band, I took a break deliberately. But at mid-life, you start thinking of mortality."</p><p>And while Juliette may be "mid-life," she doesn't look like she's aged a day in these photos!</p><p>In another snap, the 90's star shows off more of her physique in a semi-sheer bejeweled bodysuit as she works a cornrow hairstyle and a flawless face of makeup.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/50/o/2015/08/19/5022250529965b9bab3c8b43546aea2e_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Following the death of her father, the star says she's never felt a deeper connection to her life.</p><p>"It's a huge turning point in my life, this has been a bittersweet awakening. I've lost friends along the way, I'm just so deeply connected with my soul power now."</p><p>That spiritual outlook has always been important to the star, especially when it comes to her music. Juliette was the lead singer in the band <strong>Juliette and the Licks</strong>, before going solo in 2009.</p><p>"I'm independent to the core, I was never attached to big business," she explains. "That independence was important to me. I knew [my] band was my truest form, my purest voice."</p><p>What do you think of the star's candid comments?
