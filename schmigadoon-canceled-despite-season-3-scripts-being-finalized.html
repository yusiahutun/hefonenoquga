“I am sad to share that Apple will not be moving forward with season 3 of Schmigadoon!” creator Cinco Paul announced via X on Thursday, January 18. “The season is written (including 25 new songs), but we unfortunately won’t be making it. Such is life.”
Paul, 59, thanked “everyone involved” in the Apple TV+ series. “It’s a miracle we even got two seasons, honestly, and I’m so grateful we did,” he continued."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Your love and support has meant so much, and the fact that you connected with our show, that it brought some joy, means the world to me.”</p><p>While the show won’t move forward as planned, Paul revealed that he hasn’t given up hope that it’ll find a new home. “This was tough news to get, but the optimist in me is convinced it’s not the end of Schmigadoon,” he wrote. “And maybe it’s even a happy beginning.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Schmigadoon-Season-3-Scripts-Were-Written-Before-Show-Cancelation3.png><p><strong>Aaron Tveit</strong>, who played Danny Bailey/Topher on the show, reposted Paul’s message via his Instagram Story. “Thank you, Cinco, #broadwayvideo, everyone at @appletv, and this brilliant cast and crew!” he wrote. “And, of course, all the fans who came and visited our little town(s).”</p><p>Schmigadoon! premiered in 2021 and followed Josh Skinner (<strong>Keegan-Michael Key</strong>) and Melissa Gimble (<strong>Cecily Strong</strong>) as they went on a backpacking trip to a magical town where the residents act like <a href=#>they’re in a musical</a>. During season 2, Josh and Melissa traveled to a different town with different characters and <a href=#>a whole new musical vibe</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Schmigadoon-Season-3-Scripts-Were-Written-Before-Show-Cancelation-2.png><p>“It was such a kind of a whirlwind. I really did get whisked away to a magical place,” Strong, 39, <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> in July 2021 of season 1. “I got whisked away to Vancouver during a pandemic and then lived on that set for six weeks or something. Just [to work] with people that I am such fans of every day was so much fun. You couldn’t feel bad. You couldn’t keep a bad mood on that set. It’s one of the most loving environments I’ve ever worked in, where it was, like, one day [Paul’s] crying, [director <strong>Barry Sonnenfeld</strong>’s] crying, I’m crying. We’re all just, like, ‘Oh, I just love you so much.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The show also starred <strong>Dove Cameron</strong> as <a href=#>Betsy McDonough/Jenny Banks</a>, <strong>Kristin Chenoweth</strong> as Mildred Layton/Miss Codwell and <strong>Alan Cumming</strong> as Mayor Aloysius Menlove/Dooley Blight.</p><p>Despite its short run, Schmigadoon! earned a 2022 Grammy nomination for the season 1 soundtrack. The series was nominated for four <a href=#>Emmy Awards in 2022</a> and won the Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics category. At the 2023 Emmys, <a href=#>which aired in January</a> due to strike delays, the series was <a href=#>nominated for three categories</a>: Outstanding Production Design for a Narrative Program (Half-Hour), Outstanding Cinematography for a Series (Half-Hour) and Outstanding Choreography for Scripted Programming.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqcoJ2etKKwzqilZpuRo7CmuMSdZJ2do6W2tbGMrJyaq5%2BjenR50pypoqikqHqjscinnmaemaOurbXZnpto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
