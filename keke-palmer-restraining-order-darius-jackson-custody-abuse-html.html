Per court documents obtained by <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, Palmer is also asking for full legal and physical custody of their 8-month-old son, Leodis. In the meantime, a judge granted Palmer temporary sole custody of their son and a temporary emergency restraining order, in response to an emergency filing by Palmer, <a href=#>according to People</a>. Palmer has accused Jackson of hitting her and “spewing profanities” about her in front of their son. He allegedly also destroyed her property and threatened to kill himself with a gun if she left him, among other instances of abuse. Palmer further claims that she has security footage of Jackson trespassing into her home on November 5. She alleges that he “threatened” her before “lunging for my neck, striking me, throwing me over the couch, and stealing my phone.” A hearing will occur on December 5 to determine the course of action for the temporary arrangement. Shortly after the news broke, Jackson shared an apparent response on social media. “I love you, son. See you soon,” he captioned a photo of himself hugging Leodis. Last week, Jackson also shared a couple cryptic retweets, including, “being betrayed by someone you loved really changes your mindset” and “nobody apologized for how they treated me, they just blamed me for how I reacted.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I love you, son.

You a mom,” he wrote on X, prompting irritated fans to go digging through Jackson’s account and finding other controversial past posts. Palmer did not directly address the situation, but she did go on to release “I’m a Motha” merch and appear in <a href=#>Usher’s “Boyfriend” music video</a>. However, a breakup was never actually confirmed. The pair later celebrated her 30th birthday together in August, with Jackson referring to Palmer on an Instagram Live as his “partner in crime.” In September, Palmer <a href=#>evaded a question</a> on the Today show about whether she was still dating Jackson. “I’m going to take a page out of my girl Beyoncé’s book — mind y’all’s business,” she said.</p><h2 class=sources>Sources</h2><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>Us Weekly</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cllcs2ja600140iesw0pnsvn4@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Keke Palmer’s Boyfriend Who?</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cljr8gvnr000m0if4sezcft3r@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Keke Palmer’s Boyfriend Doesn’t Know His Place</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clfbqi3d3000k0igv7xr5851d@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Keke Palmer Is Kinda Getting Her Own My Best Friend’s Wedding</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cldxpxp6u00000iiij11kfexm@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Wait, Keke Palmer and Sacha Baron Cohen Are Playing a Married Couple?</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Keke Palmer Reportedly Files Restraining Order Against Ex-BF</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdhZnysscqeZKmZnKKys3nRnqqtqpGeu6q6xmamq5yVp3qlrdGirKxlmpawrL%2FOp2ScraOpvKXFjJqZrquVY7W1ucs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
