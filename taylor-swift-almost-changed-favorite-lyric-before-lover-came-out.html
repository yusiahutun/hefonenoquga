They enjoy analyzing each line and try to pin it to a part of her past or a previous break-up along the <a href=#>long list of her ex-lovers</a>. However, one fan-favorite part of the Lover lyrics also meant something else, Taylor Swift admitted, if she did go ahead to change it.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-s-lyrics-in-lover>Taylor Swift’s lyrics in Lover</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-1730743172-1024x728.jpg><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> admitted, before her record came out, she had been wanting for a romantic song like Lover to appear in her catalog for a long time.</p><p>She wanted a song people would dance to at the end of parties, weddings or even in their own home.</p><p>Tay-Tay said: “I’d been thinking for years that, God, it’d be so great to have a song that people who are in love would want to dance to,” she said. “In my head, I had the last two people on a dance floor at 3 A.M., swaying.”</p><p>The <a href=#>music</a> star also spoke about the process of writing the song, saying she wanted it to touch on simple moments and feelings in a relationship.</p><p>She <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> The New York Times: “I wanted the chorus to be these really simple, existential questions that we ask ourselves when we’re in love. ‘Can I go where you go’ is such a heavy thing to ask somebody. ‘Can we always be this close’ has so much fear in it.</p><p>But when it comes to the lyrics ‘We could leave the Christmas lights up ’til January’, Taylor Swift confessed when reviewing Lover she almost changed it to April. Initially she wondered if April would seem ‘out there’, then realized she wanted the song to reflect the simple things in the relationship instead.</p><p>Normal and mundane conversations that actually make a bond special.</p><p>“I had toyed with the idea of ‘We could leave the Christmas lights up ‘til April,” she said.</p><p>“It’s not about that being a crazy thing,” Swift added, “It’s about how mundane it is. It’s about like ‘We could put a rug over there. We could do wallpaper or paint.’ When young adults go from living in their family to then combining their lives with someone else, that’s actually, like, the most profound thing.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-love-it-after-realizing-it-s-meaning>Fans love it after realizing it’s meaning</h2><p>Not only do Swifties enjoy singing the Lover lyrics, they love Taylor Swift’s reasoning behind them.</p><p>One Reddit user admitted they didn’t appreciate it at first, but now does.</p><p>They wrote: “When I first heard it I was like, don’t most people leave their lights up til January?! I completely missed the point and now I feel bad for disliking it for so long.”</p><p>And another said: “It reminds me of my relationship with my husband, who actually told me this line. It’s about being in love with someone who wants to see you happy, and doesn’t care about what other people think of it.”</p><p>A third joked: “My mom used to take our tree down on Christmas Day so I love this lyric lol”</p><p>While someone else echoed: “That’s always been how I took it and it’s awesome to hear that’s what she intended. Songwriting Queen”.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2aEcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy02aYpaWfqMFur8eapaCdlGKzosLOq6CtnV2hxrO1wmaZnp6fp7JuuM6vnKtlk5a6pnnOrqto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
