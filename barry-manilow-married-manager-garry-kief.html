The wedding was held at 71-year-old Barry's home in Palm Springs, California, and attended by "<strong>20 to 30 guests</strong>" who were told they were attending a "lunch", a friend of the couple told People. "<strong>It was a surprise</strong>."The pair did not sign any official paperwork, but they now <strong>both wear wedding bands</strong> and "are <strong>committed to one another</strong> and have been for a very long time," another insider added.

The Brooklyn-born star apparently decided to take his relationship to the next level because "he's got his career and personal life in a great place and <strong>he really doesn't care what people think</strong>," the source said. "<strong>He's in love and happy</strong>."Barry is <strong>fiercely private</strong> when it comes to his personal life, telling the Telegraph in a 2012 interview: "<strong>You can only come into my world if I invite you in</strong>."From the very beginning that was the rule. I learnt how to deal with publicity/press thing. You just say, 'I'm not interested in talking about that…' I don't want strangers knowing everything. If that happened, that would drive me crazy."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f94d90da44f9-barry-manilow1-z.jpg><p id=eShX1FIXhnUX data-wc=11><strong>The pair have reportedly been together for more than 30 years</strong></p><p id=eLaA31L4u-7V data-wc=63>According to the National Enquirer, the publication which first reported the news, Barry’s neighbour <strong>Suzanne Somers</strong> acted as 'best man', and his assistant Marc Hulett registered online to become a minister so he could lead the ceremony.Barry has been married once before; he tied the knot with Susan Deixler in 1964, but left around a year later to focus on his music career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQbmdtaGlngXWFlWiZmqqirnqurc2io6ivXaKus77InptmpZGjrqix0WaemqqirnqstcSfZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
