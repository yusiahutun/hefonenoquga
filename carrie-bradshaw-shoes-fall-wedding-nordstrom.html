Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) famously uttered that iconic line to a pair of shoes on an episode of Sex and the City, and it's exactly what came to mind when I finally laid eyes on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>heels I'm going to wear at my wedding</a> this year. My choice, after all, was inspired by the well-known character.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I'm talking about the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">Manolo Blahnik Hangisi stilettos</a>, a pair of 3.5-inch heels with a square crystal buckle adorning the pointy toe. They're handmade with satin and leather in Italy, and also cost a cool $995.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I'm not "registered at Manolo Blahnik" like Carrie was, so I had to foot the bill for these babies myself — and it will be worth every penny on my Big day (get it?) to have these incredibly special shoes, ahem, Carrie me down the aisle. However, it wasn't until recently that I stopped balking at the price tag and accepted that sometimes, you just have to have the expensive shoes.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$995, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">nordstrom.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I've loved artful footwear since before I was even old enough to know how to style (or walk in) heels, and Sex and the City, including Parker's perpetually-pumped Bradshaw, played a pivotal role in molding my obsession. These particular shoes are part of a crucial plot point in the 2008 SATC movie. They make their on-screen debut when Carrie unboxes them and places them in the custom closet that Mr. Big has built for her in their "heaven on Fifth" penthouse apartment. They reappear at the end of the movie after — spoiler alert — Carrie and Big break up and she returns to the apartment one final time to get the shoes. Big has the same idea, they're overcome with love when they see each other, and Big re-proposes marriage by ceremoniously slipping the blue Blahnik onto her foot. In the next scene, the pair finally get married and Carrie wears the shoes that brought them back together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The romantic in me always swoons over that scene, and thinking of it (almost) cures my nausea over spending nearly $1,000 on a pair of shoes. Plus, after slipping them on for the first time, I was both blown away by how comfortable they feel and how stunning they look on my feet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I'm not a "something blue" bride, however, so the bright royal shade of Carrie's shoes wasn't the exact wedding day style I had in mind. My mom and bridesmaids will be wearing blush, and I want to get many more wears out of shoes this expensive, so I'm opting for the slightly pink nude color. They'll go beautifully with my ivory Carolina Herrera wedding gown and, post-wedding, will instantly elevate everything from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>jeans and a T-shirt</a> to a cocktail dress.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If I were to follow in the footsteps of my favorite fictional heroine and give you some advice: Just buy the shoes. Trust me, it's worth it, especially if you've been lusting after them for years and know they'll be a worthy investment. In my case, there's simply nothing quite like a pair of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">Manolo Blahnik Hangisi stilettos</a>, and if you ask me, everyone deserves their own Carrie Bradshaw moment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ykrdGroJ5lkqeupb%2FHmq5mq5iksrR5xZqjpWWnmrGltc2gZKenopnAtb7Opg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
