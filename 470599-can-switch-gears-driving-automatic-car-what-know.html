Nicholas-Joseph Cugnot built it for the French army with a speed of only 2.5 mph. Today, cars run on fuel and electricity, with some having manual and others automatic transmission. According to the current trajectory, the latter appears to be the future of cars.</p><p class=align-left>People have many questions about the proper usage of such cars, including how gears should be engaged. They want to know, "Can you change gear in automatic while driving?”</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b810ef7d1526f8e0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to request an Uber without the app</span></p></a><h2>Can you switch gears while driving an automatic car?</h2><p class=align-left>The primary ideology of an automatic transmission is that you don't have to bother altering gears while driving. Instead, the automatic transmission is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">computer-controlled</a> to keep the engine running at an optimum RPM (revolutions per minute).</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: Don't miss trending Kenyan news. Follow TUKO.co.ke on <a id=https://twitter.com/Tuko_co_ke href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>!</strong></p><p class=align-left>The car automatically does it for you while you accelerate and decelerate. The transmission automatically shifts to a higher gear whenever the RPM goes up. You have likely noticed the additional gears and are wondering when to engage.</p><p class=align-left>It is important to note that you can <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">alter some gears</a> while driving an automatic car since you have other low and high gears. However, it would help if you never touched some gears while in motion, as it can severely damage your engine.</p><p class=align-left>The good thing is that most <a href=#>modern cars</a> lock you in your current gear while driving, and you cannot shift. This is a protective mechanism to avoid mechanical problems.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/803b10722f416554.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Electric cars in Kenya: costs, charging stations, are they practical?</span></p></a><h2>How do you manually shift gear in an automatic automobile?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b810ef7d1526f8e0.jpg><p class=align-left>You must know how to shift gears in your car before going ahead with the move. Since cars are made differently, the shifter might be a button or something that mimics the traditional gear shift on a manual car.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, depending on what you have, you need to move the shifter to the desired gear or press the desired button. Make sure you release the gas pedal while doing it.</p><h2>What gears should you shift while driving an automatic car?</h2><p class=align-left>Automatic cars are different and have different gear modes. They will usually have a <a href=#>sport</a>, economy mode, or variations. You can shift between these gears while driving without worry, but you must ascertain that you do it only at the appropriate moment.</p><h2>What gears shouldn’t you shift while driving an automatic car?</h2><p class=align-left>Even though an automatic transmission is easy to drive, considering the lack of a stick-shift, there are don'ts that you need to keep in mind while operating the car. For instance, what happens if you accidentally change gears while driving?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/30b224b3f53c0379.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to catch a cheating spouse using technology</span></p></a><p class=align-left>First, there are some gears in the automatic car that you should never switch to while in motion. For example, never switch to park or reverse while driving, as it can destroy your engine. The good thing is that automatic cars are programmed to prevent you from doing this.</p><h2>Can you shift from D to S while driving?</h2><p class=align-left>You can switch from drive to sport mode while driving but at the appropriate time. For example, when your automatic car gets to a certain rotation per minute, it knows the right time to do an upshift. However, if you want the sport mode, you can do it manually if your car supports it.</p><p class=align-left>All you need to remember while shifting to sport mode is to avoid doing it while pressing down the gas pedal. It can damage the transmission.</p><h2>How to shift to a lower gear in automatic transmission</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/088d2e733309dc0c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>7 helpful ways of dating without a car to avoid turning off women</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/803b10722f416554.jpg><p class=align-left>The process of shifting to lower gears in an automatic transmission car is like that of a manual car without a clutch. You can force your car to move to lower gears using the simplest approach of slowing down by releasing the gas pedal. However, if you want to engage the lowest gear in your automatic car, you can do the following to shift:</p><ul><li>If you are in drive mode, let your foot off the acceleration pedal or brakes until it slows down to around 25 mph, then resume a steady speed.</li><li>Downshift to “2.”</li><li>If the rotations per minute increase to around 4,000 or 5,000, slow down.</li><li>You can follow the same procedure to go to "1." However, you must slow down to between 10 and 20 mph before switching.</li></ul><p class=align-left>The most appropriate time to use lower gears labelled 1, 2, or L is while towing heavy loads, climbing a steep incline, and riding down a steep hill. While towing a heavy load, you can damage your car if you try going at high speed. Therefore, using the low gear feature on your automatic car is best.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ff222501a918b0dc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Everything you need to know about motorbikes for sale in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left>On the other hand, you must go at a low speed when driving up a steep hill. Using the lower gear while riding down a steep heel is also beneficial, although most people are unaware of it. It saves your breaks.</p><h2>Is it bad to shift an automatic into neutral while driving?</h2><p class=align-left>It would help if you never switched from drive to neutral while in motion. Switching to neutral gear stops the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">fuel flow</a> to the engine, reducing your car's control as you cannot use the engine's gears to slow down. This way, you can only depend on the main brakes, putting more stress on them.</p><p class=align-left>On top of this, since you have reduced control over the car, it won't be easy to control in a situation where you need to react fast.</p><h2>At what RPM should an automatic transmission shift gears?</h2><p class=align-left>There is no set figure, and it all <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">depends on your car</a>. Modern automatic automobiles will shift at low RPMs if the acceleration is on a light throttle. But, of course, the gears will shift if you are on full throttle. It is also important to note that the figure relies on the engine. Diesel engines produce maximum power at much lower RPMs than petrol engines.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/86083512a5b2253a.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Used cars for sale in Kenya: 10 cheapest models and their prices</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Many have asked, "Can you switch gears while driving an automatic car?” The bottom line is that you can change while driving for certain gears, but you cannot for some. Therefore, you need to familiarize yourself with the gears in your automatic transmission car to know the ones to avoid. The great thing is that your car will automatically prevent you from doing the wrong thing while driving.</p><p class=align-left>Are you wondering about the most <a href=#>expensive cars</a> in Kenya? <a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> featured an <a href=#>informative article</a> providing a list of the cars with the highest value in the country owned by rich and influential individuals.</p><p class=align-left>Did you know someone owns the Rolls Royce Phantom in <a href=# rel=noopener>Kenya</a>, which is worth Ksh.45 million?
