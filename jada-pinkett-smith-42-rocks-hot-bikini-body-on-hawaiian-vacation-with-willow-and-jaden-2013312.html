Flaunting her impressive body, the mother of two laughed in a pink, tie-dyed two-piece suit with her long, braided locks secured high above her head. She played carelessly in the water and sand with her family, as she confidently walked across the beach in her itsy bitsy bikini.</p><p>During another beach outing over the holiday weekend, the Kingdom Come star wore a black bikini top and a tiny zebra-printed bottom with red lining. The star flaunted her muscular legs and toned behind in the barely-there bikini bottom. Pinkett Smith once credited her hot body to her diet. “I don’t eat for pleasure,” she told Essence magazine in 2012. “I eat for my schedule so I have to eat high-protein, lots of greens and healthy carbs so that I don’t fall flat on my face,” she added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Pinkett Smith was joined by her lean teenage daughter, who also mix-and-matched her suit in a prism-printed bikini top and and high-waisted red bottoms. Willow, who sported a similar, shaved hairstyle to her mom (with the exception of the teen’s green hair color), also caught some waves as she surfed in the beautiful, blue waters of the Pacific island. The mother-daughter duo also enjoyed a shopping trip while on the island.</p><p>Jada’s teenage son Jaden, meanwhile, was spotted on a surfboard with a paddleboard in hand; He was later joined by a group of male pals on a raft.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>On Thanksgiving Day, Pinkett Smith took to her <a href=#>Facebook page</a> to share a message of gratitude with her fans: “Let’s be grateful for our problems because there is an intelligence greater than us all that understands what challenges we need to be prepared for the inevitable blessings that arrive after we have trudged through the storm,” she wrote.</p><p>The actress topped her message with an uplifting call to action for her followers: “Your life is meant to be lived to the fullest! Don’t waste not one day!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGajmZSWerG1zaScraxdqLqqwMdma2tloqSwrL%2BMoaatZZKeuKq6yGaZqJypYryvecearpqhmZa7bsLAnJitoZ%2Bjeri106FksKGcoby4ecCnm2aikZmyr3mRaWhsa2FnfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
