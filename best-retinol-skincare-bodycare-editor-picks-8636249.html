In the interest of personal curiosity — and providing insight for those navigating the very saturated market — I spoke to my colleagues about their favorite retinol products.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-7-editor-approved-retinol-products></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>7 Editor-Approved Retinol Products</span></h2><span class=heading-toc id=toc-u-beauty-resurfacing-compound></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>U Beauty Resurfacing Compound</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>U Beauty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I have written about my love for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">U Beauty’s all-in-one Resurfacing Compound</a> many times, so I’ll try to keep it relatively brief. No product has ever had such a noticeable impact on my skin as U Beauty’s Resurfacing Compound. It’s thin and packed with active ingredients including vitamin C, vitamin E, and of course retinol.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">My skin is sensitive, acne- and hyperpigmentation-prone. This got rid of those pesky little bumps that aren’t acne but aren’t nothing, faded dark spots, and made my skin look the most glass-like it ever has.

My legs are fully covered in bumps that make me dread shorts season. I tried scrubs, washes, and even a pair of exfoliating gloves — nothing seemed to work. Needless to say, I didn’t have a ton of hope that I would find a product that could help. But after using <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Versed Skin’s Press Restart Advanced Retinol Body Butter</a> a couple of times, I could feel a noticeable change; not only were the bumps getting smoother, but I noticed there were fewer on my body. The formula is a bit pungent, but it’s easy to look past that detail once you see the change on your skin first-hand. — Christina Oehler, Senior Commerce Editor</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dr-dennis-gross-skincare-advanced-retinol-and-ferulic-perfectly-dosed-retinol></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Advanced Retinol and Ferulic Perfectly Dosed Retinol</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is the newest addition to my retinol faves category; I've been testing it since last fall. I've been a dedicated retinol user for 12 years, first to target adult acne and now as an anti-aging, skin-smoothing tool — I am in my early 30s with combination to oily skin that is not at all sensitive, so I can use high percentage retinols with no issues. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Advanced Retinol and Ferulic Perfectly Dosed Retinol</a> is an individually wrapped pad that is perfectly dosed with retinol. I swipe it over my face, neck, and chest and let it soak, then top it with a moisturizer. I love how easy and convenient the pad format is; I always know I am applying the correct amount. Besides retinol, it also features bakuchiol, ferulic acid, hyaluronic acid, and squalane for antioxidants and hydration. My skin looks smoother and more radiant in the morning when I use it — check back in 10 years to know if the long-term effect is holding up.&nbsp; — Shannon Bauer, Associate Editorial Director</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-augustinus-bader-the-retinol-serum></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Augustinus Bader The Retinol Serum&nbsp;</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I've been using the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Augustinus Bader Retinol Serum</a> for three months and, so far, I've noticed fewer fine lines, faded hyperpigmentation, and even the improved appearance of the deep 11 lines between my eyebrows. Even though it was my first time using a retinol, the serum didn't cause any dryness, irritation, or skin flaking, and I find it's gentle enough to use every day. My sensitive, combination skin looks brighter and has a remarkably smoother texture.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I do notice that some of the Augustinus Bader moisturizers are so rich that they can trigger minor acne flare-ups on my face, but the retinol serum is lightweight and absorbs beautifully, so it doesn't clog my pores or make my skin greasy. The results are so noticeable that it motivates me to stick to my daily skincare regimen, which is always a plus. And yes, it's expensive. But over the years I've spent so much money on products that don't do anything that I don't mind making room in my beauty budget for a product that WORKS. — Bronwyn Barnes, Commerce Vice President&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sunday-riley-luna-sleeping-night-oil></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sunday Riley Luna Sleeping Night Oil</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sunday Riley</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Sunday Riley’s Luna Sleeping Night Oil</a> was the first retinol I’ve ever used, and now more than a year later, I'm still extremely loyal to it. The combination of blue tansy oil and a milder retinoic acid seemingly reversed the pore-clogging, dulling effects of NYC grime and pollution after a few uses. Now, anytime I feel those infuriating little bumps along my jawline or notice that my skin looks lackluster, I slather this funny little blue serum on and have a clear-looking complexion by morning. It’s not just me — I got my entire family hooked, from my 25-year-old cousin to my 70-year-old dad. (FYI, we can barely get him to use sunscreen, but now he demands my mom repurchase the retinol because he loves how much brighter and even his skin tone looks while using it. He even compliments the botanical scent!) This is such a great option for beginners because not only does it produce immediate, gratifying results, but it’s extremely gentle on reactive skin. — Irene Richardson, Commerce Writer</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-murad-resurgence-retinol-youth-renewal-night-cream></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Murad Resurgence Retinol Youth Renewal Night Cream</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I have very sensitive, eczema-prone skin, so testing new retinol formulas is particularly a risk for me. I started using the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Murad Resurgence Retinol Youth Renewal Night Cream</a> about six months ago after having luck with the line's serum counterpart; since then, I’ve experienced little to no irritation. I love how its lightweight and fast-absorbing formula feels grease-free but still leaves my skin looking lifted, rejuvenated, and hydrated. While I can't speak to its effect on deep wrinkles, the fine lines forming around my eyes have smoothed out, and I even sometimes forgo eye cream because this formula is so effective. — Zarah Kavarana, Associate Editorial Director</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dermalogica-dynamic-skin-retinol-serum></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Dermalogica Dynamic Skin Retinol Serum</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dermalogica</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Truthfully, I'd avoided retinol for years, despite my knowledge of the ingredient as a line-fighting, pore-whittling superstar. Given the notoriously reddening, flakiness-inducing acclimation period vitamin A so often requires, the timing never felt quite right. On a whim, I tried <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dermalogica's Dynamic Retinol Serum</a> in hopes that, true to its product description, the formula would spare my naturally dry skin. Amazingly, it's delivered on its promises of sensitization-free wear; I've been using it for a few months now and have yet to experience any flakiness whatsoever. What I have noticed: smaller-looking pores and faded fine lines. — Sophie Wirt, Beauty Commerce Writer<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6qrWWimsGqus6lZKyjmaOwor7EZpmonKmYrrOxjJ6boqyfp3qxtcKkqmZwZmiDc4CY</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
