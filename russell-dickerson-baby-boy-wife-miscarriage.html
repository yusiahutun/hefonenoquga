"The reason it was hard is, you see a heartbeat on the ultrasound. And then you go back in and there's nothing."</p><p>"Our first pregnancy&nbsp;was — they call it a chemical pregnancy, which, like, it's not an actual forming of being, you know what I mean?&nbsp;This one was like, 'There's the heartbeat.' You're relieved. Then, they're like, 'It's looking a little small' ... downward spiral and then you go back in and there's no heartbeat."</p><p>It's not uncommon for Dickerson to find his mind drifting and his eyes watering, he says. When she announced the miscarriage, Kailey spoke about how she was embracing family and very close friends during this difficult time, and the same is true for Russell. He notes that he hasn't found a community of men who've gone through similar.</p><p>Currently, "God Gave Me a Girl" sits in the Top 5 on Billboard's Country Airplay chart. The song is the second radio single from his self-titled album, released in November of 2022. Parmalee, Restless Road and Niko Moon are joining him on the Big Wheels and Back Roads Tour, which lasts into November of 2023.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Oh, Baby!
