She is the daughter of Nicole Ponsetto and Eric Ponsetto. She also has a brother who has managed to stay out of the public eye.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/aa2d96f73eecdb80.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Renee Portnoy?

Her mother used to work as a technician at a<a href=#> plastic surgery</a> practice in Los Angeles. In addition, she has been in trouble with the law, including when she was arrested with her daughter for public intoxication.</p><p class=align-left>Miya Ponsetto’s father and brother have distanced themselves from the scandal. Her brother allegedly deleted his social media accounts when her video went viral to avoid being associated with the scandal.</p><p class=align-left>Ponsetto grew up in their mother's home at Piru, Ventura County, California. She attended Simi Valley High School, where she was part of the <a href=#>cheerleading squad</a>. She graduated from the school in 2016.</p><p class=align-left>Ponsetto is an American national and is of mixed ethnicity. Initially, people believed her to be Caucasian, which led to her being accused of racism. However, she later revealed that she identifies as Puerto Rican and has Italian, Greek, and Vietnamese ancestry.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/eeba410a3d423250.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Trinidad Cordona's sexuality, parents, nationality, and career</span></p></a><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>What does Ponsetto do for a living? After Ponsetto went viral, many people started digging into her life, looking to uncover information about her. One of the things that people discovered was that she used to work as a receptionist at Richard Mille's watchmaking company in Beverly Hills, California. However, it is not clear whether she still works at the company.</p><p class=align-left>Ponsetto has tried out her luck in modelling and acting. She has a profile on<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> ExploreTalent, </a>which she created looking for acting and modelling gigs. On top of that, she has an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Etsy account</a>, where she sells iPhone cases.</p><p class=align-left>Sometimes after she went viral, there were rumours that she planned to launch an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Only Fans account</a>. She might have wanted to capitalize on her fame (or infamy) and earn money online by selling content.</p><h2>Dating history</h2><p class=align-left>Another aspect of Ponsetto's life that the public and media have scrutinized is her dating history. Not much has been revealed, despite many rumours detailing several people she was allegedly dating, which have not been confirmed.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d417cd30c45d1adb.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Sssniperwolf's boyfriend? Is she married to Evan Sausage?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>A report revealed she was – at one time – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">living with a man</a> in an apartment in Los Angeles. Ponsetto and the man, presumably her boyfriend, got into trouble with the law after being sued for failing to pay rent. Unfortunately, his name was not revealed, and she has not revealed anything about her romantic interests.</p><h2>Miya Ponsetto's viral altercation</h2><p class=align-left>What happened during Miya’s viral incident at the New York hotel? Ponsetto was staying at Arlo SoHo Hotel in New York. On December 26, 2020, she allegedly lost her phone and accosted two other hotel guests, 14-year-old Keyon Harrold Jr. and his father, Keyon Harrold, at the hotel's lobby.</p><p class=align-left>Ponsetto accused Harrold Jr. of stealing her phone, demanding he hand over his phone, claiming it was hers. When Harrold Jr.'s father refused, Ponsetto chased after the teen, grabbing his clothes and tackling him to the ground. The teen's father recorded part of the altercation before physically restraining Ponsetto to keep him away from his son.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/019f89822d6f452a.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Masako Katsura's biography: The 'First Lady of Billiards'</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Ponsetto's phone was later found - having been returned by an uber driver. Keyon Harrold senior shared his recording online, enraged by the incident, which went viral. After a while, Miya was identified, and social media users gave her the nickname SoHo Karen due to her seemingly racially charged accusation of the black teenager.</p><h2>Did Miya Ponsetto apologize for her alleged racism?</h2><p class=align-left>After the SoHo hotel altercation video went viral, social media users leaked Ponsetto's personal information online. She was also trolled by many social media users, who claimed she was racist. On top of that, there were widespread calls for her arrest.</p><p class=align-left>Ponsetto held a live interview with CBS's <a href=#>TV host</a> Gayle King to quell the fire. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">During the interview,</a> she defended herself, claiming that she was a “sweet person." In addition, she claimed she was scared and alone in New York, hence her actions.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e500975ec267bfb7.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rachel Campos-Duffy's husband, family, net worth, height, salary</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Ponsetto did offer an apology during the interview for her interaction with the 14-year-old teenager. However, she claimed that Keyon Harrold, the teen's father, had also assaulted her and "slammed her into the ground." However, she vehemently denied racism claims.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately for Ponsetto, the interview was not received kindly by the media and the public. She was faulted for her demeanour, especially her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">disrespectful attitude</a> towards TV host Gayle King. On top of that, many people felt that her apology was not genuine, and claims of racism continued even after it was revealed that Ponsetto had Puerto Rican heritage.</p><h2>Did Miya Ponsetto go to jail for assault?</h2><p class=align-left>In January 2021, Ponsetto<a id=https://nypost.com/2021/01/08/miya-ponsetto-returning-to-nyc-to-face-charges-for-alleged-attack-on-black-teen/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> appeared before a court</a> via video link and agreed to return to New York, where she was charged with grand larceny, attempted robbery, assault, and endangering the welfare of a child.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3765aca9f978ed7b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Buck from Mountain Monsters bio: job, wife, net worth, weight loss</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Ponsetto was later indicted by a New York grand jury for aggravated harassment, endangering the welfare of a child, and unlawful imprisonment.

She has been fighting her charges stemming from the incident in court, and she only reached her plea agreement in April 2022.</p><p class=align-left>She is also facing other charges in Los Angeles, including a 2020 DUI charge that saw her receive three years probation and community service.
