Sharing a recap of the show on Instagram, Gayle King snapped a photo of Channing wearing a black tee that read, "It's me, hi. I'm the daddy, it's me" in blue-and-pink hand-painted letters. He paired his shirt with denim cutoff shorts with distressed hems, face jewels in the shape of a heart over his left eye, and the ultimate dad accessory: a fanny pack slung across his chest.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Gayle King Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Saturday night! @taylorswift in LA w/fav daughter @kirbybump!

"A round of applause to @channingtatum & @karomobrown who went all in!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">King also included a hilarious video of Tatum enthusiastically dancing to Swift's 2014 song "Shake It Off" in the carousel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is far from Channing's first cute dad moment. Back in June, the Magic Mike star made the internet collectively swoon when he revealed that he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>learned how to braid Everly's hair</a> after splitting from his ex-wife Jenna Dewan. "I didn't plan to be a single dad, that was not in the cards, in my planning at least," he said during an interview on&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Today With Hoda and Jenna</a>. "And I was pretty nervous, I was like,&nbsp;'she's a girl.' I was like looking up YouTube on how to braid hair, you know, I didn't want to be the dad that was delivering a kid to school looking like she just slept on the street."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wqGYp6aZo7RuwMCtrKZlkaPBqnnHnqmoZZSWsW6%2Fx6KprWWklsatu9FmqrChlql6pLvNnJyrrF1sgnh8k2ls</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
