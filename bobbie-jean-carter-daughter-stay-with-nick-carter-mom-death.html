I know why Leslie, Aaron, and now you ended up in the circumstances that you did. I share that pain we experienced during our childhood and I’m sorry you didn’t have an opportunity for a better life."</p><p id=eLGR9KP6ZMD data-wc=34>Angel then wrote about the importance of breaking down barriers and reducing mental health stigmas, directing fans onto the charity On Our Sleeves.
