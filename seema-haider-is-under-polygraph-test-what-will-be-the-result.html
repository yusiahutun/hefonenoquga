Almost four years later, she and her four children were able to enter Indian country. It appears to be the plot of a masala Bollywood film, right? The question now is whether she crossed the Indian border for love or for other reasons. The authorities apprehended a suspected ISI spy in Lucknow on Sunday. It is unclear whether she is only a cross–border lover.</p><p>In March of this year, the 27-year-old Seema Haider met Sachin for the first time in Nepal. She was able to enter India two months later. According to accounts, she flew from Pakistan to Dubai. She traveled to Nepal and then passed into Indian territory with a legal visa. It is still unclear how she entered India with proper documentation.</p><p>The UP ATS is now looking into her travel route. She faces charges for violating the Foreigners Act, the Passport Act, and sections 1208 (participant in a criminal conspiracy) and 34 (act done by several people with common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.</p><p>She came to India to be with Sachin. And further stated that she had accepted Hinduism and pleaded with the authorities to enable her to marry Sachin. On July 4, local police in Ballabhgarh, Haryana, apprehended her for unlawfully entering India, and they also arrested Sachin for providing refuge to illegal aliens. All three individuals, including Sachin’s father, were arrested, but they were released on bail on July 8.</p><p>The officials are looking at the entire situation. Seema’s husband, Ghulam Haider had asked her to return to Pakistan. Currently, he is residing in Saudi Arabia, and he has recently expressed his anxiety for Seema and her children’s safety during an interview on you tube. Seema’s friends and family members have abandoned her as she left Hinduism and is not a Muslim anymore. The authorities subject her to the Narco test for further investigations.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Narco-Analysis Test</h5><p>Investigators subject Seema Haider to narco examination for in-depth investigations into the case. The truth serum, commonly known as narco test, has been previously employed to resolve crucial cases. The test comprises the systemic delivery of a medication (such as sodium pentothal, scopolamine, or sodium amytal) that induces several degrees of anesthesia in the individual receiving it.</p><p>During the hypnotic stage, individuals experience a decrease in inhibition and an increased tendency to disclose facts that would typically remain concealed in their conscious state. When other evidence fails to provide a clear picture of the case, the investigative authorities turn to this test. The rules also require obtaining the person’s agreement before subjecting them to a narco test.</p><p>The Supreme Court ruled that subjecting individuals to narcoanalysis, brain mapping, or polygraph testing without their consent is prohibited. In response to petitions disputing the constitutionality of such exams, the Supreme Court stated that they are illegal and violate personal liberty.</p><p>The psychologist then meets with the investigating officer (IO). The professionals engage in a conversation with the suspect, informing him about the test as his agreement is necessary. The process begins only after the psychologists are satisfied that the suspect has comprehended the situation, and they proceed to evaluate him physically.</p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>Use of Macro Test</h6><p>Experts believe that the nacro test lowers a person’s inhibitions by messing with his or her nerve system at the molecular level. Investigators make attempts to collect probative truth regarding the crime while the individual is in this sleep-like state. The determination of the dose of the injected substance takes into account factors such as the individual’s gender, age, health, and physical condition.</p><p>The investigating agency grills the suspect in the presence of doctors. The investigators videotape the revelations made at this point. During the evidence-collection procedure, the investigators utilize the expert’s report. A government hospital carries out the procedure following a court order.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Polygraph Test</h5><p>According to the reports, Seema Haider might have to undergo Polygraph test. ATS has multiple confusions and doubts regarding her illegal entry in India. During the July 17 interrogation, it was discovered that Seema Haider had contacted several people in India before Sachin. The majority of the persons Seema contacted were from the Delhi NCR. Therefore, there is a high probability for her to undergo this test .</p><p>Lie detector tests (also known as “Polygraph tests”) are one of the cutting-edge forensic scientific technologies that have proven to be extremely useful during police investigations. On one hand, some view this approach as a harsh and demeaning investigation technique, while on the other hand, others consider it useful for investigating serious or vicious crimes. Believe it or not, when applying for certain jobs, individuals may undergo lie detector or polygraph tests, such as those required for government positions with the FBI or CIA.</p><p>The goal of a lie detector test, as the name implies, is to determine whether a person is telling the truth or lying when answering questions. However, the administration of this test differs from narcoanalysis and brain mapping. But, in India, are they legal? This is the main topic of conversation. In the days following the Delhi Police’s request to conduct a polygraph test on Aaftab Poonawala, a suspect in the killing of his partner Shraddha Walker, the media has once again raised questions about the legitimacy of polygraph tests.</p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>The following sensors are recorded in the Polygraph test:</h6><ul><li>Person’s breathing rate</li><li>Person’s pulse</li><li>Person’s blood pressure</li><li>Person’s perspiration (sweat)</li><li>Sometimes, we also record arm or leg movements.</li></ul><p>When the polygraph test begins, the questioner asks a few questions to establish the norms for the person’s signals before moving on to genuine questions. The interrogation records each of the person’s signals on the moving paper.</p><p>So, during or after the polygraph test, a polygraph examiner looks at the graph to see if the vital signs changed considerably on any question. A faster heart rate, greater blood pressure, and increased sweating or perspiration, for example, all suggest that the person is lying.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Examining the Balance</h5><p>Therefore, our current criminal justice system prioritizes individual liberty and freedom, weakening it because the groundbreaking instruments used by forensic science to decode the truth have no validity or admissibility in a court of law except under certain conditions. While criminals can flee without facing charges for insignificant crimes on one hand, on the other hand, Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Indian Constitution protect the freedom and right to privacy.</p><p>Narco-analysis tests can help improve criminal justice by strengthening the evidentiary system, but they can also be immoral. In conducting a criminal investigation, it is essential to keep in mind that everyone is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty.</p><span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">News</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Reading & Math Science Enhance English Learners’ Performance:</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 2, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">News</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>During the perimenopause, women are 40% more prone</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">News</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Uncategorized</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Bomb Threat in Delhi-NCR Schools: It Can Cause</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">News</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Raghav Juyal advocates for stopping plastic pollution, Urges</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Motivation</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">News</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Appearance over Achievement?: UP Board Topper Trolled for</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>May 1, 2024<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sb%2FYnJ%2BopJ%2BcwG%2BvzqZmrJ2Voq5utMCim56qXZ7AbsHNnZyrZaCkubqz0ZqnoWWkmsC1edahmK1lp565rXnBnmStoJViv6a%2F1KWraA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
