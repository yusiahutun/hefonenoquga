Another said, “I love your hair cut.” A third added, “Looking as beautiful as ever. Love your make-up and hair. You are an amazing coach.”</p><p>Since Kelly won <a href=#>American Idol</a> in 2002, she’s changed her look a lot. The “Stronger” performer used to have brown hair before she went blonde in 2012 and in June 2018, she also <a href=#>lost a little bit of weight</a> by eating cleaner.</p><p>“I’m not working out! I think people think I’m working out and I’m like, ‘Don’t think I’m going to come play some sport!’” she revealed to <a title=_self href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Extra </a>about how she keeps herself in shape. “I literally read this book, and I did it for this autoimmune disease that I had and I had a thyroid issue, and now all my levels are back up. I’m not on medicine anymore because of this book, it’s called The Plant Paradox [by Steven R. Gundry, MD].”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/shutterstock_editorial_10550304aa.jpg><p>“It’s basically about how we cook our food, non-GMO, no pesticides, eating really organic. Literally, I haven’t worked out at all!” she continued.</p><p>Not only that, but Kelly’s new diet has made her feel so much better. “She feels like she can be an advocate for a healthier lifestyle. This isn’t something she did to get skinny. <a href=#>She did it for her family and for herself</a>,” an insider told <a href=#>Life & Style</a> in July 2018. “She really is in a great place.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46knKWkqWKwra3RpKqopqNitaK10WaqoqaXmr9usMSbrK2rXZuuo8HLqKysZZ6axG60wKKprKypobJw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
