Hodge called and congratulated Berlin on Wednesday morning.
“It was very professional,” Berlin said.
Winning the heated race was a much different experience than his first foray into politics four years ago, and it’s been eye-opening, Berlin said."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

You see who your real friends are and you see people that you gave an opportunity to stab you in the back. It’s been tough.”</p><p>Asked what he would say to the 67 percent of the voters who cast their ballot for another candidate, Berlin said, “Jones County is my home, and we’ll still do all we can to make it safe for everybody. We’re going to be bigger and better than ever.”</p><p>A total of 20,554 ballots were cast for a turnout of just over 46 percent of the county’s registered voters. At press time, there were still an estimated 200 affidavit ballots to be counted and 67 outstanding mail-in ballots that can be counted if they’re postmarked by Nov. 7 or before and received in the circuit clerk’s office within five business days. Because of that, the results are unofficial and uncertified, but there weren’t enough uncounted votes to change the outcome of any race. The closest was the sheriff’s race, which had a 274-vote differential between Berlin and Hodge before the remaining 267 ballots were counted.</p><p>“We did not win this race, but we did run it faithful and true,” Hodge said. “We are thankful beyond measure for the wonderful moments we shared on this very special campaign journey over the last year. We appreciate every supporter we’ve encountered along the way. To God be the glory!”</p><p>Hodge finished with 31 percent of the vote, well ahead of Macon Davis (24 percent), who unseated Hodge in the Republican primary in 2019 before falling to Berlin in the general election. Berlin, Hodge and Kenny Rogers were running as Independents and Davis was running as a Republican again.</p><p>Davis’ wife Shelly thanked supporters on her Facebook page.</p><p>“We are heartbroken and devastated in the results, but we know God has bigger things in store for Macon,” she wrote. “We will hold our heads high! We ran a very clean race and a professional one at that. I am proud of how my husband presented himself and our family during his campaign.”</p><p>Rogers, who pulled a little more than 11 percent of the vote, posted “Congratulations to sheriff Joe Berlin GOD bless you sir love you brother.”</p><p>Greg “Red” Dickerson received more than half of the votes to be elected circuit clerk in another four-candidate, county-wide race. He won the Republican runoff over Kim Knight then faced a trio of Independents — Thomas “Cliff” Prine Jr., Melissa Buchanan and Denis Borges — in the General Election.</p><p>“It’s a relief,” Dickerson said with a laugh. “I’m just proud for the people who supported us and worked so hard.”</p><p>Dickerson was in the courtroom from the first to last reading of results, taking it all in since he will be in charge of handling elections for the next four years.</p><p>“I was paying attention to as much as I could,” he said. “Going through the primary, then the runoff and now this, I’ve learned a lot about the process.”</p><p>Circuit Clerk Concetta Brooks, who was unopposed in her run for chancery clerk, was celebrating the conclusion of her eight-year run as circuit clerk as absentee ballots were still being counted right at midnight.</p><p>“I went to as many precincts as I could today since it was my last election,” she said.</p><p>Brooks was particularly pleased to see that almost half of the county’s registered voters cast ballots in the race after dismal turnout in the primaries and runoff.</p><p>“That was a pleasant surprise,” she said. “I feel good about the numbers. I’m excited that Jones County stepped up. It’s encouraging.”</p><p>In other contested races, Republican challenger George Walters won big (63 percent) in the Beat 1 Supervisor race and Democrat incumbent Travares Comegys won even bigger (72 percent) in Beat 5 over Independent Derrick Barber. Walters beat longtime incumbent — and his boss — Johnny Burnett in the primary and beat a pair of Independent challengers in the General Election.</p><p>In other contested races, Republican Travis Haynes beat Democrat Marian Allen in the race for District 3 Justice Court Judge, Republican Wayne McLemore won big (71 percent) in the District 1 Constable race over James Stiglet and Republican incumbent Danny Gibson beat predecessor Larry Strickland with 63 percent of the vote. Stiglet and Strickland ran as Independents. McLemore will fill the seat that was held by Mike Sumrall, who did not seek reelection. Coroner Burl Hall lives for another term after stopping Democrat challenger Pamela Huddleston dead in her tracks with 71 percent of the vote.</p><p>Michelle Blackwell received more than 61 percent of the votes to win Beat 2 Election Commissioner over Laura Howse for the non-partisan position that was held for many years by Marilyn Huff, who did not run for another term.</p><p>Elected officials will take the oath of office in January.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcK7Eq6Oipl2XrqS3jKKlaJmiqbakuMSYaGppZpeFerGMcJxwm11mfqaxjJtqnWtdZYB3fZacb3FsZpuwb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
