Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Laslo Djere 6-4, 7-6, 6-4 on Saturday to back up his two-day epic against Andy Murray and reach the last 16.
The Greek has the flowing locks of Bjorn Borg and the flowing backhand of Roger Federer, but until recently he has not shared their love affair with the lawns."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Djere is the world No 60 and this is the furthest he has ever gone at Wimbledon, but it was hard to begrudge Tsitsipas a plumb third-round draw after facing former US Open winner Dominic Thiem in his opener followed by double Wimbledon champion and home hero Murray.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Those both went to five sets and sprawled across four days, so today will be his first day off this week.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It’s the first time this week I’ve made it easy for myself,’ he said. ‘I’ve had a few thrillers the last few days. It took Noah 14 days to build the ark and it feels like the last two matches are equivalent to something like that.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I’m really happy with how I dealt with all the situations today on court, keeping it on point.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Of course, the three-set win this time means a lot. Hoping to recover better and get back in action the next few days. Just a little bit more rested.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The 24-year-old was largely untroubled against his Serbian opponent and bounced back well from the only major setback, as he recovered from 3-1 down in the second set to force a tiebreak.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The No 5 seed’s draw continues to look inviting, with surprise package Chris Eubanks next up on Monday. ‘We have a similar game style,’ he said of the unseeded American. ‘He serves and volleys. He takes the ball early.</p><img id=i-17045d41aa4ad211 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/07/08/23/73002517-12278687-image-a-12_1688855112180.jpg height=487 width=634 alt="The Greek star beat Great Britain's Andy Murray in a thrilling five-set match on Centre Court" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The Greek star beat Great Britain's Andy Murray in a thrilling five-set match on Centre Court</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘We haven’t played each other before. I like his game but I’m going to try to do the best I can to break it or to impose my game over his. His serve will be something that will be challenging for sure. I will try to make him work for it.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There is a lot to like about Tsitsipas’s game on grass. He moves forward effortlessly and volleys with graceful precision. His slice backhand is improving and his old-school eastern grip on the forehand helps him whip balls up off the low-bouncing grass.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>His biggest issue has been the return of serve, especially on his backhand side. For too long in his career he stood well back to return — a valid tactic on clay but do it at Wimbledon and then watch the serves whiz past.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He has stepped further up the court now and uses a chip or block return more often on that side — as Federer did so effectively here to neutralise his opponents’ serve.</p><img id=i-2c5decd7f8d34860 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/07/08/22/73001629-12278687-image-a-22_1688851682270.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Tsitsipas stated that he now has greater comfort in attacking and playing from the baseline" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Tsitsipas stated that he now has greater comfort in attacking and playing from the baseline</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Asked about how he has developed his grass-court game, he replied: ‘One thing that has improved from last year is my comfort attacking and playing from baseline, sticking close to the baseline and rallying. Something that wasn’t the case so much last year. I feel good staying back and rallying and trying to come up with big shots.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘My serve and volley game is also an asset that I use from time to time, as a surprise element or whenever I feel like I really want to be aggressive on this point.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘But my overall approach this year is much more refined, much more disciplined in many areas.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Tsitsipas may never win five of these Championships in a row like Borg or Federer, but he is on the right track at last.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Follow MailSport on Threads here: <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>https://www.threads.net/@mailsport</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e9Oepaeho2Sus8DInKOeZWFnf3iElXFuaIukmrOius6sZI2rmanAqrzArGSlp5%2BgwG6z0ZqqrGWfq7Kzr86mnKxlfJbArbuMfaGeqpViv6atwqFkkKGdl7mmsM6nZGpuXp3Brrg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
