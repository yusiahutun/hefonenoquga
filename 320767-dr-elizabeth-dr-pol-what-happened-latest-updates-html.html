She is a veterinarian. Most people came to know about Grammer when she started making appearances on <i>The Incredible Dr. Pol</i>. The television series aired on the National Geographic channel. On the show, she was cast to play the role of a veterinarian.</p><h2 id=320767-what-happened-to-dr-elizabeth-on-dr-pol class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>What happened to Dr Elizabeth on Dr Pol?</h2><p class=align-left>Why did Dr. Elizabeth Grammar leave Dr. Pol? What happened to Dr Elizabeth Grammar on Dr Pol? These are some of the questions at the back of fans'.

Sources report that Robert went home drunk that day and asked his <a href=#>wife </a>for some medication because he was feeling unwell.</p><p class=align-left>Dr Elizabeth responded to the request and handed him half a millilitre of Butorphanol. Butorphanol is in the same class as morphine. Medics administer this drug to labouring women, patients with migraines, and to animals in pain.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, Robert proceeded to <a id=https://gazettereview.com/2018/05/what-happened-to-dr-elizabeth/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">inject himself </a>with the drug and soon after he was unresponsive. His first stop was at the Monroe County Hospital. The case was a bit serious and the doctors transferred him to Macon Medical Center where he was put on life support.</p><p class=align-left>Days later when the police were continuing with the investigations, they were shocked to find Dr. Elizabeth <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">unresponsive </a>in her house. She had attempted to take away her <a href=#>life </a>by injecting herself. Thankfully, the medical professionals were able to save her life and she was later taken to the psychiatric ward in Macon.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/29f7f60421339144.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Mike Tyson's daughter?

So why did Dr Elizabeth leave Dr Pol? Given all those unfolding events, Liz decided to leave Dr Pol and lead a low-profile life.

Because of her decision to stay away from the limelight, it is hard to tell what she is upto nowadays.</p><p class=align-left>Allegedly, she is practising in a private facility known as Animal Amour Veterinary Hospital and Pet Lodge, in Hampton, Georgia.
