In a year where scalping is at an all-time high, Lyte’s scalper detection technology was our X-factor.”</p><p>“Jay and his team are fun to work with because they don’t stop innovating, despite the festival being one of the longest running and most successful in North America. They just don’t stop,” added Ant Taylor, Lyte CEO. “Lyte Exchange activity was at an all-time high this year, as folk fans are anxious to get back to the Fort. This bonus inventory release further thwarts the nefarious, unaffiliated secondary market.”</p><p>The Newport Folk Festival is one of several major events that have partnered with Lyte in a bid to reduce scalping, including Life Is Beautiful, Pitchfork Music Festival, Under The Big Sky, Riot Fest and Baja Beach Fest.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ35wfJdoaGlnnK7BpnnTnpimq12qvW7DyK2fZqaVrL2wvtNmnaikm2Kzpr%2FToq2apF2pvG6v0ZqapGWUpMSvec6nZK2hk6CytXnSnJilqJWnwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
