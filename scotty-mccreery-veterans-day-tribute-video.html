Written by&nbsp;Kyle Jacobs and Preston Brust, this is a song the 'American Idol' winner sings every night on tour. The meaningful tune is even accompanied by a heartwarming video while he's on stage.</p><p>Now, he's sharing the video with fans everywhere in light of Veterans Day.</p><p>The clip was created by&nbsp;Josh Carter and it pays tribute to U.S. Marine Lance Corporal Andrew Carpenter in a beautiful way. Carpenter, a native of Columbia, Tennessee, passed away in 2011 from a fatal wound during his second tour of duty in Afghanistan. His wife, Chrissie, was pregnant at the time with the couple's first child, Landon. Carpenter holds a special place in McCreery's heart because Chrissie is the cousin of his bass player. When McCreery heard the heartbreaking story, he had to tell it.</p><p>“My family and I have always been thankful for the men and women who protect us and lay down their lives to keep all Americans free,” McCreery explains in a release. “When Nathan told me the story about his cousin’s husband, I knew it was a very personal way to connect our audiences to the song ‘The Dash.’ On this day when we honor our military veterans, I could think of no better way to show my respect than to make sure my fans have a chance to know Andrew and his story. RIP Andrew -- there is no way I can truly thank you for your sacrifice, but I can make sure you are never forgotten.”</p><p>Watch the beautiful, heartwarming 'The Dash' video which pays tribute to Carpenter above.</p><p><strong>Country Stars Who Served in the Military</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmrJufqcG6ecycmqudlafGbsLErZyrmZ6oeqWt2Garq6GSqsGmedWim56nXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
