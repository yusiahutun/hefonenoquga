After undergoing a two-part review process, Great Iowa Nurses are honored at an annual ceremony.</p><p>In addition to recognizing outstanding nurses, the Great Iowa Nurses program provides financial support to nursing students in MSN, DNP, or Ph.D. programs. Since the program’s inception in 2004, 131 Genesis nurses have been named Great Iowa Nurses.</p><p>A virtual ceremony will take place later this year to recognize the 2023 honorees.</p><p>“Genesis continues to be grateful to our nurses, who have been asked for so much personally and professionally over the past few years,” Joel M. Moore, Chief Nursing Officer, Genesis Medical Center, Davenport. “This honor is an opportunity to recognize all Iowa nurses, especially our own nurse who is being recognized as one of the Great Iowa Nurses.”</p><p>100 Great Iowa Nurses was established in 2004 and hosted by the University of Iowa until 2020. In 2022, with the support of Mary Greeley Medical Center, the program was revived and renamed Great Iowa Nurses.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaJ6eppWotrR5za6prJ1do66uscNmpqedXaSzbrXOsJisZZKawLV7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
