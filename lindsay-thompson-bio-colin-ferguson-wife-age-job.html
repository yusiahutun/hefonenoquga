Keep reading this Lindsay Thompson Bio to learn all about her.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Lindsay Thompson, Colin Ferguson Wife</b></h3><p><span>Lindsay Thompson is Colin Ferguson’s wife. The two reportedly married in 2012 — that same year Colin skydived at the Lompoc Airport to raise money for 18 for 18: Project Rescue to help end human trafficking.</span></p><p><span>In case you don’t know, Colin was a part of the Vancouver group that helped put “CARING INTO ACTION” by raising money doing the highest skydive in North America – 18,000 feet. Originally, their goal was to raise at least $1 per foot, but to their surprise, they raised over $72,000 total!</span></p><p><span>During the skydiving event, Lindsay was also there with Colin.</span></p><p><span>Besides that, Lindsay also attended Friends To Mankind’s 2nd annual 18 for 18 charity event and fundraiser at</span><i><span> Lexington Social House</span></i><span> on August 19, 2012, in Hollywood, California.</span></p><p><span>So, it’s clear that the husband/wife was into philanthropy.</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, we don’t know if Lindsay and Colin are still together. But we do know that Colin’s busier than ever filming </span><i><span>The Summer I Turned Pretty </span></i><span>season 2.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Colin portrays “John Conklin” in the Amazon Prime show. He is Belly and Steven’s father, who was dating a younger woman after his divorce from Laurel. The last we saw him, he was trying his best to be a good father to his kids. But clearly, there is some tension between them!</span></p><p><span>Before marrying Lindsay, Colin was in a relationship with E Fairysistere from 2007 to 2010. Also, the actor dated Renee Faia from 2006 to 2007, and Claire Coffee from 2004 to 2005.</span></p><h3><b>Do Colin Ferguson And Lindsay Thompson Have Kids?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, Lindsay Thompson and Colin Ferguson share a son. They welcomed him in late 2013. Sharing the good news of his arrival, Colin took to his Twitter on September 6, 2013, to write, “Mother and son are happy, healthy, and napping. Thanks so much for the kind words, everyone.”</span></p><p><span>Their son then joined kindergarten in the fall of 2018, and now as of 2023, he’s in school.</span></p><p><span>Back when Colin interviewed alongside his co-star Jewel to promote their show, </span><i><span>Deadly Deed: A Fixer Upper Mystery</span></i><span>, he said, “I think part of her [Jewel’s] soul would die if she did a duet with me.&nbsp; She’d probably say it was the worst noise she’d ever heard.” So, instead, he joked that he was reserving his vocal prowess to do rhymes with his son. “I will do these long rhymes with my son and now he’s rhyming — that’s really fun.”</span></p><p><span>“But when it comes to acting the only thing he ever thought about me being on TV was that I had the worst job ever.&nbsp; You go to a location and everyone tells you to be quiet. He just saw it as everyone telling you what to say, and then to shut up,” he added.</span></p><p><span>Overall, Colin loved his son and always put his family first. “The career will push me out when it’s done with me, probably in the most unceremonious way, as it generally does. But my family won’t,” he shared. That’s why he urges everyone to “put the effort where it’s important.”</span></p><p><span>“I would never want him to have an issue because I wasn’t around because I chose my job over his well-being. And he’s also a good guy. He’s the best,” Colin talked about being there for his son.</span></p><h3><b>Lindsay Thompson Age</b></h3><p><span>Lindsay Thompson was at least 35 years of age in 2023.</span></p><p><span>She looks a lot younger than her husband Colin who was born on July 22, 1972.</span></p><h3><b>Lindsay Thompson Job</b></h3><p><span>Lindsay Thompson didn’t reveal her job.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, her husband Colin is a well-known actor with over 69 movies and TV shows to his name. Some of them are </span><i><span>The Summer I Turned Pretty </span></i><span>(2022), A</span><i><span> Thousand Little Cuts </span></i><span>(2022), </span><i><span>Private Eyes </span></i><span>(2018 – 2019), </span><i><span>Deadly Deed: A Fixer Upper Mystery</span></i><span> (2017 – 2018),</span><i><span> You’re the Worst </span></i><span>(2017), </span><i><span>Every Christmas Has a Story</span></i><span> (2016), </span><i><span>Haven</span></i><span> (2013 – 2015), </span><i><span>Eureka</span></i><span> (2006 – 2012), and more.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But Colin was never born to be an actor. He was an incredibly shy child! He did do some school plays, but only because he was the reader for the teacher when they were auditioning. Fortunately, by the time he got to university, he met a friend who said he wanted to improvise with him for a drama. “So I did. And from that one class, after the class, they said, ‘We’d like for you to join the group,’”</span></p><p><span>Thus, he joined their group, surrounded himself with people who were doing it professionally, and ultimately got side-pocketed with one of their agents.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>Is Lindsay Thompson On Instagram And Facebook?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Lindsay wasn’t on social media.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t even appear on her husband’s IG @</span><a href=#><span>cferg101</span></a><span> and Twitter @</span><a href=#><span>colinferg</span></a><span>.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Where Is Lindsay Thompson From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Lindsay is likely from Canada</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>When Is Lindsay Thompson Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Her birthday wasn’t shared.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmpaGemcCixYytn6iloKi8r3nBoqZmm5%2Bhtq95xZ6poK2jpLtuw8ifnGaZl5p6q7vBaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
