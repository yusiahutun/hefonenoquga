She always said that her parents named her after a road that was also named Harmony. I (sorry Harmony) used to think that was kinda dumb. I mean obviously, her parents knew that the name harmony was a musical term and liked that. It must have been more about that than the road itself. Now I don’t. I learned all these neat connotations about the name afterward, but I didn’t know all that stuff at the time, I just like the name I saw elsewhere and took it.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibmKe2tK%2FOsqCeql6jsrV7kWloamdgZnxxf46doKCaqWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
