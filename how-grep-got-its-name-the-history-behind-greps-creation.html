Grep's Origins at Bell Labs Like many other modern Linux tools, Grep is a descendent of the original Unix system developed at Bell Labs in the 1970s."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They also used slow<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Teletype machines</a>, which utilized line editors to edit text. Ken had already written his own program that allowed text searching by using regular expressions.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Thompson packaged these text searching features into his&nbsp;own utility. Because this utility globally searches lines for regular expressions and prints them, it became "<strong>G</strong>lobal&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>egular&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>xpression&nbsp;<strong>P</strong>rint," or simply Grep.</p><p>Kernighan also interviewed Ken Thompson at VCF East in 2019, and Thompson had an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">amusing anecdote about grep's creation</a>. Thompson's boss, Doug McIlroy, approached him about the need for a text searching utility. Thompson promised to work on it overnight, but really only spent about an hour fixing bugs, since he'd already written Grep and had been using it privately. He presented it to McIlroy the next day. And the rest is history.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><span class=related-single><strong>Related:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>Unix vs. Linux: The Differences Between and Why It Matters</a></span></p><h2 id=grep-s-role-in-linux-culture-today>Grep's Role in Linux Culture Today</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/gnu-grep-manual.png><p>Grep is still important to modern Linux culture, even though Linux doesn't use any Unix code. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GNU Grep</a> is the most used version of Grep, as it comes preinstalled in almost every Linux distribution.</p><p>You can use Grep to search for a text pattern in a file:</p><pre><code class=hljs>grep pattern file</code></pre><p>Or you can search for patterns in a piped output:</p><pre><code class="hljs javascript">ps | grep <span class=hljs-string>'.*sh'</span> </code></pre><p>The <strong>ps</strong> command prints all the processes that are currently running on the system. Grep will search for lines in the output that are followed by <strong>sh</strong>, or running shells in practical terms.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Since the normalization of electronic documentation, programmers prefer having a utility that allows them to search for patterns in text files. They even refer to the lack of search in printed documentations by&nbsp;humorously saying&nbsp;"You can't grep dead trees."&nbsp;They have also termed the act of&nbsp;physically searching for things as <strong>visual grep</strong> or <strong>vgrep</strong>. This shows how much Grep permeates modern Linux and the computer science culture in general.</p><p><span class=related-single><strong>Related:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>How to Shorten Man Pages Into Readable Explanations on Linux and macOS</a></span></p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=get-out-and-grep>Get Out and Grep!</h2><p>Now that you know where the Grep name comes from, you'll be able to Grep some great things on your own as you expand your Linux knowledge.</p><p>Grep is one of the many commands that will help you in getting comfortable with Linux.
