Dree Hemingway, great-granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway and daughter of actress and former Playmate Mariel Hemingway, is the first star to grace the pages of the &#34;non-nude&#34; magazine.
The actress, 28, looks stunning in the intimate pics, where she shows a little skin in a cream ruffled top and matching underwear. And while she doesn't go full frontal, like former centerfolds, she's still seen in the buff."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And while she doesn't go full frontal, like former centerfolds, <strong><a href=#>she's still seen in the buff</a></strong>.</p><p>"My pictorial captures all of me -- the sexy Dree, the childlike Dree, the funny Dree, the tomboy, the Lolita," she says of her photo spread.</p><p>"Playboy's images were so iconic in the 1960s, beyond anything else going on at the time. That's the dream for me, to be a part of that, because so many publications especially in fashion, throw out the same exact story," she adds. "There's nothing to compare this next chapter to. Not to mention, my mother posted for Playboy years ago."</p><p>The <strong>"While We're Young"</strong> star may come from a famous family, but she doesn't let the Hemingway legacy define her. "I'll break down my family in two seconds," she tells the mag. "They're my family. My last name isn't anything but a wow factor. It says nothing about me."</p><p>Dree admits that people have a misconception about who she really is.</p><p>"I once heard that people thought I was wild and crazy, which is funny," she reveals. "I wear my heart on my sleeve and don't listen to what other people think about me. But with this pictorial, I do want people to see me in a different way than they have."</p><p>Snapchat/Instagram model <strong>Sarah McDaniel</strong> covers what Playboy has dubbed <strong><a href=#>its "historic March 2016" issue</a></strong>, which hits newsstands February 12.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/58/o/2016/02/04/58e4a530c0e1534ab9e553148fb7a0c4_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Theo Wenner/Playboy</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnd7j2tmaWxfmb%2BmsYyhnKahnpzEosWMqaOasZKkxm6yyKuqrWWepLtuutSdnGablaPBpr7FqKOdZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
