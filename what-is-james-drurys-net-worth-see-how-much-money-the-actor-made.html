Then I’d go to another episode where I had the starring role, and I’d do several pages of script. And then I’d go someplace where Gary Clarke maybe had the starring role. It was fascinating how it all worked out, how it was all put together.”</p><p>When he was asked why fans loved the series so much, James simply said it’s because of the great storyline. “I think people respond to it because they get involved in the story, and it takes them away from their own problems, which is the definition of entertainment,” the actor gushed. “That’s what we were able to do, so I was very pleased and honored to be part of it. I still am quite proud of the show. And rightfully so, I believe.”</p><p>James is <a href=#>survived by his two sons</a>, Timothy Drury and James Drury Jr.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn5qsXZ7AbrbAppysZZSnwrPF0malnqxdrLyzwMdmqp6dXZ28uHnMrpqhZZ2ku6bFjK2fnmWRmMGwvoymmJ2dXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
