But, not for Colin Christy. Well, how does that make sense?</strong></p><h2>Husband Of Debrah Stern; Son In Law Of Howards Stern</h2><p>A multidisciplinary <a href=# rel=noopener>designer</a> by profession, <strong>Colin Christy</strong> is married to the daughter of the famous radio host, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Howard Stern</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Alison Berns</strong></a>. Christy is indeed the husband of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Deborah Jennifer Stern</strong></a>, who is also better known as Debrah Stern. The two walked down the aisle in October 2016 in an intimate ceremony.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/03/29/colin-christy-and-his-wife-deborah-stern-on-their-wedding--1585486999.jpg width=450 height=338 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Colin Christy and his wife Deborah Stern at their wedding. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Radio Gunk</span></strong><p>Whilst Stern rocked navy suits, his beautiful bride stunned in a white bridal gown at their big day which took place in San Francisco. Both Christy and his wife chose to keep their private life as secretive as possible. Though Mr. Christy is active on Instagram, it's highly used for business purposes only.</p><h2>Colin Christy; Race Heritage & Ethnicity</h2><p>As a son in law of the famous radio host as Howard Stern, a lot of the fans are often curious to learn about the background race and ethnicity of Colin Christy. And, by the looks of his face and facial features, anyone can assume he is Asian.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/03/29/colin-christy-is-half-japanese-he-is-here-photographed-with-wife-debrah-stern-and-family-members--1585486891.jpg width=450 height=448 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Colin Christy is half Japanese. He is here photographed with wife Debrah Stern and family members. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Pinterest</span></strong><p>Well, Colin is half Japanese and half white. The core acknowledgment of his heritage, however, is a bit mystery. Since Colin himself is super private and keeps his personal detail closer to his vest, it's a struggle to dig into to figure out more information on that matter.</p><p>Christy was born and brought up in the States though. He was also educated in America.</p><h2>Career & Net Worth Of Colin Christy</h2><p>Since his name is linked to elite media personality like his father in law, it's natural for the public to think <a href=# title="Colin Christy">Colin Christy</a> is after Debrah's money. But, what they don't know is the fact that he is independent on his own, something proved by his <a href=# rel=noopener>LinkedIn</a> profile.</p><p>Christy is a successful businessman. The <a href=# rel=noopener>reparative designer and environmental artist</a> is the founder of Hapa Inaba Designs and holds a major experience of years in the respective industry of designing and furnishing.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/03/29/colin-christy-and-debrah-stern--1585487245.jpg width=450 height=452 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong><span class=imageCaption>Colin Christy and Debrah Stern. </span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Reddit</span></strong><p>Before he worked as an ESL Teacher at Language Link Vietnam in 2013 and 2014, Christy began off his career by working at Swarm Gallery as a Gallery Associate. Christy then worked at Hanes Gallery as a Gallery Associate, Guest Services Manager at GeoEx (Geographic Expeditions), and CCA Connects Fellow at East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation (EBALDC).</p><p>Then, after Christy founded Hapa in 2015, he worked at California College of the Arts as a teaching assistant. But, in the meantime, he has been involved with If/Then Studio and Off The Grid since January 20019 and January 2020.</p><p>Christy who makes a decent earning holds a net worth of no less than <strong>$100,000</strong>.
