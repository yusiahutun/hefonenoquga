Standing next to the NFL star’s mom, she was cheering for <a href=#>Travis Kelce,</a> who plays for Kansas City Chiefs.

The third Kansas City Chiefs game that the Anti-Hero crooner attended showed fans the cozy family dynamics Tay Tay had with the Kelce. Along with having a really fun time with Travis’ mother Donna, fans also spotted the Style crooner having deep conversations with Trav’s father, Ed Kelce.</p><p>Making an effort with a potential love interest’s parents is definitely long-term goals. If it was only meant to be a fling, spending time with their family wouldn’t be a top priority. But Taylor has been seen engaging in conversation with his mom and dad more than once. She’s genuinely interested.</p><p>Mama Kelce also sported a major clue which showed she is definitely in support of the couple.</p><p>The 71-year-old celebrity mom sported friendship bracelets on her wrist that are very popular at Taylor Swift’s concerts.</p><p>Not only that, but the singer even merged her fandom with Travis. She was recently seen with a friendship bracelet on her wrist at a recent game – something her fans love to exchange at her concerts. But Taylor’s featured ’87’, Travis’ shirt number.</p><p>She didn’t shy away when the paparazzi snapped the duo up, either. The pair were <a href=#>seen holding hands</a> and smiling for the cameras.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-insider-says-taylor-isn-t-like-travis-ex-girlfriends>Insider says Taylor isn’t like Travis’ ‘ex-girlfriends’</h2><p>While Taylor and Travis (or Traylor as Swifties call the couple) are yet to make the relationship official, a close source of the NFL heartthrob <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reportedly</a> says the Grammy-award-winning <a href=#>music</a> icon is unlike anyone Travis has ever dated before.</p><p>“It was very unexpected for his friends, but he’s so into her and very, very happy,” the insider revealed.</p><p>They added: “Some people thought he was just joking around <a href=#>about the bracelet</a> and having a crush on her earlier this summer, but he was serious about it.”</p><p>While his friends may not have been aware of it, Travis has been ‘manifesting’ meeting Taylor since he attended her Eras tour. He talked about how he made a friendship bracelet to give it to her, only to be ‘rejected’ over a face-to-face. But that’s because she doesn’t meet anyone before or after her shows due to the strain on her voice.</p><p>The NFL stud was ‘butthurt’ but knew all too well not to give up as he sent an invitation to the Blank Space singer to attend a Kansas City Chiefs match instead. Taylor accepted the invitation, leading to Travis pouring praise on the singer. He was left swooning over how she looked ‘amazing’ in the VIP box chatting up with Mama Kelce and cheering for his team!</p><p>“I just thought it was awesome that everybody in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her. She looked amazing and everybody was talking about her in great light,” Travis said afterward.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2aEcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy02abq6egqHqurcmoqWabnKqybrXTrGSgnaSptq%2BzjKycq6GfqsBuw8itn2asopbDqr%2BMpJylm5Vk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
