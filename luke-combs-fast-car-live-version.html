Combs <a href=#>wrote on Twitter</a> when he teased the live version. "Thank you, Tracy Chapman, for one of my favorite songs of all-time!"</p><p>Chapman, who wrote "Fast Car," originally released the song in 1988 as the lead single off her self-titled debut album. It was a massive hit, peaking at No. 6. on the Billboard Hot 100 and winning her a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.</p><p>Combs' cover version became his 16th consecutive No. 1 hit at country radio, and that's just the beginning of the milestones his "Fast Car" cover has achieved. The song <a href=#>marks the first-ever No. 1 </a>on the country chart to have been written solely by a Black woman. It also peaked at No. 1 on the Hot AC chart and No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, and has achieved RIAA 2x Platinum status in just five months since release.</p><p>Next up, Combs is kicking off a string of Australian World Tour dates on Wednesday (Aug. 16). He'll take a break in September, as he and his wife Nicole are <a href=#>expecting their second child to arrive that month</a>, before continuing his World Tour with a batch of European dates.</p><p>The singer also&nbsp;just announced another stadium tour for 2024, called the <a href=#>Growing Up and Gettin' Old Tour</a>.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Top 20 Luke Combs Songs That Prove 'Em All Wrong</h2><p>Check out Luke Combs' best songs, and the songs that changed his life when so many thought he wasn't good enough to be a country star.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpa2bmnqku8ybqmaekajBbq%2FAq2Sloaaaerex0aygqKZf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
