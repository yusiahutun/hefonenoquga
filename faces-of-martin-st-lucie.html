She is a five-year breast cancer survivor, and she recently commemorated her 40th work anniversary with the Visiting Nurse Association of Florida (VNA). Her dedication to helping those in need, resilient nature and strength of character has contributed to her longstanding success, both personally and in the healthcare industry. She believes her professional success is due to her guiding principles of commitment, persistence, loyalty and pride. She also believes the VNA is the best home-health agency around, another contributing factor to her longstanding success. “Working for a home-health agency that focuses on patient health and well-being, as well as employee health and well-being, is very rewarding,” she says. When reflecting on her past cancer diagnosis, she attributes the experience to her tenacity and ability to connect with patients on a personal level. “It has brought me more insight and clarity and has helped me understand what my patients may be feeling,” she says. The VNA is a nonprofit, Medicare-certified, home-health agency that has been providing superior care to patients on the Treasure Coast and across the state for more than four decades. Its range of services include companionship care, skilled nursing, disease management, physical therapy, post-surgical care, wound care, in-home visiting physicians and more.</p><p><strong>772.286.1844 • <a href=#>vnaflorida.org</a></strong></p><p>Sponsored content</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tMDUmqmtpZGcrru1zZ5lnKedZLOir8SsZKieXaKus8DIp2SsrF2hwqS1xGiroZ1dm66ksYyonWampafAqrrGaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
