In fact I would forget about time passing. I would forget about the lunch break and everything else,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ferragamo started her brand in 2017 after studying architecture and then a masters in jewellery design at Central Saint Martins in London. She opened her first boutique in Milan in late 2022 and has plans to open another in the near future. Her jewellery is stocked by the likes of Browns in London, and online retailers Farfetch and Moda Operandi.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1eav71q e1haapfp2">Sustainability is very stimulating – I find it much more stimulating starting from a limited resource, for instance, or a material that’s not perfect and finding creative solutions</figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/01/fc6ad2b5-7158-4d68-9ce7-725b11a80d87_6ca0bf61.jpg><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">You started making jewellery when you were very young. What did you love about it?</strong></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What I love in the first place is that it was something that made me so happy and I was in control whether to do it or not to do it. I could decide to start working on a piece of jewellery and I would feel happy. I think that this was linked to working with my hands. It was just the process of creation, starting from something that was not there yet and that thanks to the work of my hands and my mind it would take form and become something new.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">How wearable is sculptural fashion off the runway?

This process of creation is really an act of love and I think that this is something that has not changed since I was very little. The role of jewellery itself – even though I was very young – I would see how something very little and simple perhaps could transform your look, but also your mood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/01/cc2eb83b-955c-4f09-8f37-ce0747f8ce23_aa6d195d.jpg><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Talk us through your creative process.</strong></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I follow a very precise creative process. I’m very disciplined, [but] of course open to possibilities. I always start from a mood board that’s made up of images that I collect that inspire me. I find inspiration from many worlds, currently [it’s] repetitive patterns and geometry. I’m literally obsessed by them, and they can be at any kind of scale and in any kind of environment. In architecture, but also in nature, they can be in a hardware shop or construction sites. I gather together my sources of inspiration.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/01/768b34c7-e6c2-4332-aa71-0d881d63a789_066e1ebd.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Then I give myself a brief and I start iterating from this mood, taking one element of inspiration and the many possibilities that it can have into the brief. From the drawings I move on to making a model and then it’s a constant narrative process between model making and drawing. Basically I work really intensively on the prototyping and the iteration until I get to the final prototype where I know I can stop. I feel that harmony has been reached. Then I go to my artisans and together we implement the technique and the way to reproduce it in series.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Would you buy luxury jewellery you’d never even seen online?

I encountered this abandoned material and I reacted to that. Over time, of course I deepened my sustainable principles, and they became very much linked to upcycling. In fact, I started upcycling other materials.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/01/75818a6d-1f6a-4663-aa6e-f671064b40c4_6ca0bf61.jpg>But really the truth is a mindset and I think that is never a point where you arrive, but it’s constantly asking yourself questions and trying to do a bit better every day. And also for me, sustainability is very stimulating – I find it much more stimulating starting from a limited resource, for instance, or a material that’s not perfect and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">finding creative solutions.</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZqWtqKq%2FunvJnq6epJyav7p7wKuropucmnx0fpJsaGlvX6Kus7XAZqqopJVis6a%2B0ZqemqWfYsC1sc%2BpoKefXaTCtXnHnqlmnpGitq3F0madqKekqMGmvNJmnqudkal6qL7Ap5udmaWctbWx0WagrZmcnq6vecuur66qqWLAqbvEppiknaI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
