Pete Davidson wanted a second opinion about the size of his penis -- and he got one.
During a stand-up comedy show at Tarrytown Music Hall in New York over the weekend, the &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Davidson joked, according to <strong><a href=#>US Weekly</a></strong>. "We hooked up, and I asked her, 'Okay, what is [the size of my penis] in comparison?"</p><p>"She said, 'Well, it's nice, but it's like an average black man's. It's nice, but like the size of an average black dick,'" Davidson recalled. "So I thought, 'Okay, that is white privilege.'"</p><p>Grande made the phallic reference on Twitter in June of last year after a fan asked her, "How long is Pete??? Oh, as in the interlude, not as in... Anyway." The pop star replied, "Like 10 inches? Oh, f--k...I mean...a lil over a minute." Grande has since deleted the tweet.</p><p>At the time, Davidson seemed unbothered. He even joked about his member two months later during a performance at Auburn University. He described being engaged to Grande as "f--king lit" and said his "dick is forever hard."</p><p>Looking back, though, Davidson thinks his ex-fiancée's comment was "mean" but "also genius."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:fd6a0364-f57c-51b4-a23e-ea4cc08da784 data-container-ref=toofab:article:5084c4d2-91e0-5dcd-81e3-3460242f2c88 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=30><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ed/5by4/2019/01/04/ed68e5c66f0b5bb3a68757d87569294b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kris Jenner Warns Ariana Grande About Chlamydia, Jennifer Coolidge Cracks Her Up In 'Thank U, Next' Bloopers</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I don't like that she talked all that shit [about] my penis," he said Saturday, according to <strong><a href=#>PEOPLE</a></strong>. "Everything is huge to her. Why would she tell everyone that I have a huge penis? So that every girl who sees my dick for the rest of my life is disappointed?"</p><p>Even after the two split in October, Grande continued to talk about her ex's manhood. In her "Mean Girls"-inspired revenge song, "Thank U, Next" -- which dropped 30 minutes before a new episode of "SNL" aired -- Grande wrote "HUUUUUGE" in her "Burn Book" next to a photo of Davidson.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
