The iconic and timeless <a href=#>music</a> genre is achieving major popularity, fuelled by some of its biggest rising stars like Morgan Wallen, Zach Bryan, and surprisingly <a href=#>Post Malone</a>, whose country covers are winning fans over big time. When it comes to the heavyweights though, singer-songwriter Tim McGraw has been in the ring for years. He released his debut studio album in 1993 and since then has had 10 hit number one on the Top Country Albums charts. For many followers of the Something Like That singer, it would be hard to imagine a world without him—and yet, not so hard for the man himself…</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-874698932-1024x765.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tim-mcgraw-says-he-would-ve-died-already-if-he-hadn-t-married-faith-hill>Tim McGraw says he ‘would’ve died already’ if he hadn’t married Faith Hill</h2><p>Now 56 years old, the <a href=#>celebrity</a> has been getting introspective about life in recent years, especially during a previous <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a> with Apple Music. He made the grand claim that he wouldn’t be here, and his career would not be where it’s at, if not for marrying his wife shy of 27 years ago, Faith Hill.</p><p>“I guarantee you, had I not gotten married to Faith at 29 years old, A, I probably would’ve ran my career into the ground. B, I would’ve died already with my career into the ground, one or the other, and it wouldn’t have ever been where it’s at now.”</p><p>Acknowledging his years of alcoholism to interviewer and host Zane Lowe, he explained Faith stuck through him during the “wild years” before he got sober and shaped up in 2008.</p><p>“Well, I don’t know if the maturity’s occurred yet,” he admitted, “but she put up with it for a while because I was pretty sneaky about it for a while. But it was just overdoing stuff, and then I think when the kids got old enough that they could notice things is when she finally said, ‘You’ve got to figure this out.'”</p><p>Tim Married Faith, also a successful country musician, in 1996, following a divorce from ex-husband Daniel Hill two years prior. Tim and Faith have raised three daughters together: Gracie, Maggie, and Audrey.</p><p>Not only do they work together as a family, but creatively too. “I’m always playing her the<br>songs that I want to record and playing the mixes as I’ll go along,” he shared, “and there’s times we don’t agree.” She’ll always tell him when she doesn’t approve of a sound, and he returns the constructive favor with her music.</p><p>He also shared the two always knew they wanted a family, getting married at the same age of 29.</p><p>“… We had had enough success at that time that we could pick and choose when we wanted to work and how we wanted to work,” he said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-star-shares-some-of-his-most-emotional-music-on-last-album>Star shares some of his most ’emotional’ music on last album</h2><p>Tim’s sixteenth studio album Standing Room Only released in the summer of 2023, and you can stream it on the likes of <a href=#>Spotify</a>.</p><p>Although so many records into the game, that hasn’t dulled his shine. Tim himself regarded the material as “some of the most emotional, thought-provoking and life-affirming music I’ve ever recorded” in a press release.</p><p>More recently, on the other hand, he was featured on the Pitbull single Get Get Get Down with Vikina, which was released earlier this February. Along with the Standing Room Only Tour which began in March, it’s another incredibly busy year so far.</p><p>But you know what he’d sing: live like you were dying.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2h9cK%2FOrqWtqqliuaazxKebZqyZonqur8armLBlp6TCrbDVnmSdoZWZeqK40Z6YnbFdnrNutMRmm6Kcnql6rq3Rq7Bmr5mbsm6ywKKroWWYnrmtew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
