Nevertheless, de Matteo joked that she's had to "put him in his place" from time to time about it.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d340605f-d289-4e77-9875-446a1f1b71cf data-container-ref=toofab:article:ab49bd85-6413-43ba-a6ef-7a5b10bd8bf6 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c2/5by4/2023/09/14/c242e49a566c41b6aed384310e82feb6_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Drea de Matteo Joined OnlyFans After Not Following Hollywood Rules: 'I Don't Want to Be at the Mercy of Mandates'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>She joked that she'll tell him, "Do you like that jacket you just asked me to buy you? You like all the things that you want that make you happy? You like that new PC that you begged for for Christmas --because you wouldn't have that s--t if Mommy didn't show her a--!"</p><p>The jacket was real, though, with de Matteo saying she bought her son a Moncler jacket with money she's made on OnlyFans. Prior to taking the plunge onto the new platform, de Matteo said she was down to $1,000 in her bank account.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>She explained that job offers from Hollywood had dried up after she refused to comply with vaccine mandates in the industry.</p><p>"I didn't know this was going to have to be a change of life, you know, all of a sudden that during a time I'm supposed to be relaxing a little bit, that I would have to switch careers and figure new things out because my own industry thinks I'm, you know, a savage," she told <a href=#><strong>Fox News Digital</strong></a> back in September 2023.</p><p>"I guess you could say I was a bad girl because I did not follow the rules a couple of years ago. So, I don't want to be at the mercy of mandates or strike or anything like that ever again," she added, referring to the Hollywood strikes happening at the time.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:811f8306-a237-4aa3-a946-ff34005539a0 data-container-ref=toofab:article:ab49bd85-6413-43ba-a6ef-7a5b10bd8bf6 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/75/5by4/2024/03/13/759cf77ec65a4d819b14e77d455d66b9_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">X/TooFab</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Teen Mom Stars React to Tyler Baltierra's OnlyFans: 'Definitely Not a Subscriber!' (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The actress said she's taken a lot of abuse for her decision to turn to OnlyFans, including being called "desperate," but she can't deny it. "Damn right I was desperate," she said on the podcast. "I was f--king desperate and I hope you're never desperate."</p><p>Back in February, she talked about how OnlyFans helped her save her house, which was in foreclosure after a flood. At that time, she explained that she'd taken a forbearance to help with mortgage payments, but she couldn't afford what she owed.</p><p>Just five minutes changed all that, per de Matteo. "I kept putting more pictures up," she shared with <a href=#><strong>The Daily Mail</strong></a>. "It was like, holy s--t. In five minutes, I was able to pay back Compass Real Estate, who kept the sale of my house."</p><p>"It saved us," she told the outlet. "OnyFans saved my life, 100 percent. I can't believe I'm saying that, but it really did save us."</p><a id=gallery-link-d9f92cdb-477c-45f5-a5f5-a4dc9684f4cd class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:d9f92cdb-477c-45f5-a5f5-a4dc9684f4cd data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:ab49bd85-6413-43ba-a6ef-7a5b10bd8bf6 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/dc/4by3/2024/04/03/dcba815ca0a1443ab5200fd772ff016e_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21maWxfmb%2BmrYydnGalkanBpruMpKCdq12itrmxw2apnpmTqbawutJmpqekqZuur7%2BMq5icsV2YrrO5xKdknqSVmMGzrYysn6inpGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
