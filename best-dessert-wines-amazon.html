So why wouldn’t you have it for dessert? We aren’t talking about spending time at a wine bar after dinner with your friends, though. There’s a specific group of wine that falls into the dessert character, and your favorite cab isn’t a member of this exclusive club. Ports, madeira wine, sherry, cordials, a selection of sweet white wines and any fortified wine that is technically over 14 percent alcohol. Your average glass of wine has about 12 percent. These wines are traditionally paired with sweet desserts, like cakes, so the flavors match.</span></p><p><span>There are specific glasses made for these fortified wines. They’re typically much smaller than your average glass and are a little taller, so the flavors come out properly. Plus, you’re drinking a higher alcohol content wine, so the smaller glass makes sense from that standpoint. These elegant little glasses are stronger than they look, though. You don’t only need to pull these out when you’re pouring some port. Throw your wine tasting party and use these glasses for your smaller tasters.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We rounded up the best dessert wine glasses below.

Cascata 6 oz Dessert and Port Wine Glass</h2><p><span>These small 6 oz. dessert wine glasses might not be as big as what you’re used to drinking out of, but they’re meant to be smaller to make your choice of dessert wine as flavorful as possible.
