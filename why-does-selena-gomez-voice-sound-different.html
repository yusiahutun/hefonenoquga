Selena Gomez fans no doubt have been swept off their feet with her impeccable acting, though this should not come as a surprise after her equally amazing acting in Wizard of Waverly Place.</p><p>Her acting skills aside, one thing that’s really stood out is the 30-year-old singer-actress’s voice. If you have wondered why Selena Gomez’s voice sounds different, you are not alone; fans all over have noticed something’s a bit off with her vocal range, especially in Only Murders.</p><p>So, what’s up with that Selena Gomez voice change? Let’s find out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why Does Selena Sound Different On “Only Murders In The Building?”</h2><p>Selena Gomez plays Mabel Mora on the Hulu hit mystery-comedy series Only Murders in the Building. The show premiered in 2021 and is set to be renewed for a third season after two successful runs.</p><p>Ever since she launched her acting career, there’s been no doubt that Gomez is one helluva actor. Unsurprisingly, she’s received significant critical praise, including being nominated for a Critical Choice Television Award for Best Actress in a Comedy Series.</p><p>Her role in the series is one of Gomez’s most significant works in her career. But the Come & Get It singer has left her fans wondering why her voice sounds different.</p><p>Word on the internet spread that Selena’s voice on the comedy show had changed. Some of her fans have been comparing the actress’s voice as a child star on Wizards of Wavery Place to her voice on Only Murders, and her tone sounds so different.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Madeline Kahn Connection: A Vocal Resemblance</h2><p>It’s not just Selena’s fans who have noticed the change in her voice. Some astute viewers have drawn parallels between her vocal tone in “Only Murders in the Building” and that of TV icon Madeline Kahn.</p><p>Madeline, known for her distinctive voice and comedic timing, left an indelible mark in the world of entertainment. The comparison is intriguing and speaks volumes about the versatility and depth of Selena’s voice.</p><p>To be likened to such a legendary figure as Madeline Kahn is not only a compliment but also a testament to Selena’s evolving vocal prowess.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>So, what happened to Selena Gomez’s speaking voice?</h2><p>Well, the reality is that people sound different as they age. When we are kids and teens, our actual voice and vocal tone tend to be high-pitched, but this evens out over the years, and we gain a deeper and more stable voice regardless of our gender.</p><p>But we should also keep in mind that the crooner was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, which might also affect her physiological, emotional, and mental wellbeing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Selena Gomez’s Diagnosis Might Have Affected Her Speaking Voice</h2><p>In 2012, Selena was diagnosed with lupus, an autoimmune disease that can cause organ damage and constant pain all over the body. It is an untreatable disease, but lifestyle changes and medicines can help keep it in check.</p><p>In September 2017, Gomez announced to her fans via Instagram that she had undergone a kidney transplant because of her lupus. Actress and close friend Francia Raisa donated her kidney as a friendly gesture. Even though this did not cure Gomez’s lupus, it helped extend her life and wellbeing.</p><p>In an ELLE magazine interview, Gomez admitted that lupus brought on other health problems, including high blood pressure and kidney issues, which have caused the beautiful actress to become self-aware of her weight and general appearance.</p><p>The medication she takes for Lupus, combined with the disease’s effects, led to weight gains. She has been receiving a lot of slack for this, even though it is not her fault whether she loses or gains weight.</p><p>“I noticed people began attacking me for my weight fluctuations. It is totally out of my control, and that really messed me up for a bit,” she said.</p><p>Scientific studies have found that in most patients with lupus, there is also a decrease in vocal intensity. Lupus can also make the patient’s voice shimmery or jittery, and their vocal harmonics may sound weird. This might also explain Selena Gomez’s voice change.</p><p>Also, like everyone else, Selena’s voice was bound to change as she grew older. But the fact that lupus can change a person’s voice explains why the Love You Like A Love Song crooner sounds different these days.</p><p>According to Gomez, Lupus is a challenge she has to navigate daily, but she is taking it in stride. The Spring Breakers star is doing her best to stay physically and mentally healthy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Selena Is Using Her Voice To Promote Mental Health</h2><p>Selena Gomez is a big advocate of mental health and uses her voice (through music and interviews) to raise awareness of mental wellbeing. Her Rare Beauty line is a platform the former Disney Channel star uses to spread positivity, body confidence, and self-acceptance.</p><p>In an interview with Bustle, the songstress said, ”With Rare Beauty, I wanted it to be something much more than simply makeup. I believe holistic health is about your mind, body, and soul. Makeup should, in some cases, be therapeutic, and you should have a healthy and fun relationship with your makeup.”</p><p>Selena’s makeup line was named after her single, Rare. The vegan, cruelty-free line includes more than 40 concealer and foundation shades of blushes, highlighters, and lip products.</p><p>The music superstar says she intends for her products to “give people the tools they need to break down unrealistic standards of perfection and feel less alone.”</p><p>In addition to her physical health struggles, the pop star has also battled with mental health issues. She admitted, ”In the beginning, it all seemed hopeless, and it was even challenging for me to get out of bed some days. But I never stopped asking for help; it was the hardest part, which is why I am stronger now.”</p><p>So, hopefully, this lays to rest the question: why did Selena Gomez’s voice change? We hope she keeps her head high because we and millions of her fans worldwide want to keep hearing her beautiful voice and watching her excellent acting for years to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjOrKqynpmasW%2BvzqZmsKCpYrGwsdJmqp6klaOubrPOppyzZaaktqSxjKymrqaUYrGqssWeqZ6mpGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
