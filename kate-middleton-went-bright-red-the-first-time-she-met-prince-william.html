Catherine and the future king of Great Britain (Prince William) met during their student days. The royal pair both studied at St Andrews University, and it was here where their friendship blossomed into something more. However, after more than two decades together, Kate Middleton has admitted the first time she met William – now the Prince of Wales – it wasn’t exactly a meet-cute type of encounter."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Hanging out in the same friendship group allowed their feelings to develop for each other.</p><p>Even though Buckingham Palace and the press agreed to leave the young, budding prince to study in peace, he was still recognizable. Fellow students still knew he was, including a young Catherine.</p><p>After announcing their <a href=#>celebrity</a> engagement 13 years ago, the pair gave televised interviews about the happy news. In a resurfaced clip from 2010, we can see Kate reflect on their first moment. But Wills was left scratching his head. Princes, eh?</p><p>When asked about the moment they met, the dad-of-three struggled to recall the encounter. He admitted he would have to “wrack his brains”. Although it could have been the pressure of the interviews, or being put on the spot.</p><p>But Kate was eager to spill the adorable introduction.</p><p>She explained: “I actually went bright red when I met you and scuttled off, feeling very shy about meeting you.”</p><p>As confident as the Princess of Wales is now, from <a href=#>award show</a> premiers to royal events, she wasn’t always this way.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-took-time-to-get-to-know-each-other>‘Took time to get to know each other’</h2><p>The future Queen added: “William wasn’t there for quite a bit of the time initially, he wasn’t there for Fresher’s Week, so it did take a bit of time for us to get to know each other.”</p><p>Fresher’s Week is the start of term, where British students slowly transition into college life and meet fellow learners.</p><p>But the 41-year-old then divulged: “We did become very close friends from quite early on.”</p><p>Reports say the pair remained as pals for some time, until Wills saw Kate in a student fashion show. The future royal was strutting her stuff on the catwalk in a sheer mini dress. It’s claimed he told his friend “Kate’s hot” and caught feelings for her.</p><p>Who would have known they would go on to have Prince George, Louis and <a href=#>Princess Charlotte</a>?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kate-and-william-s-heartbreaking-brief-break-up>Kate and William’s heartbreaking brief break up</h2><p>However, despite forming a strong bond while younger, the duo did break up three years before William got down on one knee.</p><p>In 2007, the couple split, and it was much harder for Kate than William.</p><p>While looking back at the brief heartbreak, the 41-year-old dad said: “We did split up for a bit. We were both very young, it was at university, and we were both finding ourselves and being different characters and stuff.</p><p>“It was very much trying to find our own way, and we were growing up.</p><p>“It was just a bit of space, it worked out for the better.”</p><p>But it’s clear the Princess was devastated by it at the time.</p><p>She confessed: “At the time I wasn’t very happy about it, but actually it made me a stronger person.</p><p>“You find out things about yourself that maybe you hadn’t realized.</p><p>“I think you can get quite consumed by a relationship when you’re younger.</p><p>“I really valued that time, for me as well, although I didn’t think it at the time.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2aFcLfArZxmpZmZsa2x06ilZq%2BVo8FurtGinqGsXaeypXnToZxmnpmnwLV506KknmWjnbJuucStZKmqmaOwpnnWoqOloZGifA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
