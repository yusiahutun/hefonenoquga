Power up the app, and it will scan your connected network. It will also show nearby access points, information about signal strength, the type of protection a network employs, and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fing's scanner discovers all devices connected to a network, which lets you see a device's IP address, name, model, MAC address, and so on. With Fing, you can also <a href=#>test your home network's speed</a>, see if any security issues need to be resolved, set up alerts, and ban devices.</p><p>It should be noted that you need to purchase the Starter or Premium version of Fing to access all features, but the basic one is free, and what it offers should be enough for the vast majority of people.</p><p><strong>Download</strong>: Fing for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MacOS</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Android</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> (Free, subscription available)</p><h2 id=netspot>2.

It's a more complicated (and arguably more advanced) tool than Fing, so it is intended for more technically-minded users.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>NetSpot automatically discovers all Wi-Fi networks in the area and provides live data about them. This includes information about security, signal strength, speed, configuration issues, signal leaks, network stability, and much more. This data can be exported as reports, whether in PDF or CSV format, making NetSpot a valuable tool for IT and network administrators.</p><p>While it is true that NetSpot is primarily used to analyze network strength and coverage, the data it extracts can prove valuable if you suspect security issues with your home Wi-Fi.</p><p>Bear in mind, however, there are different versions of NetSpot. You can use the tool for free, but with limited features, the availability of certain functionalities may vary depending on your device's operating system.</p><p><strong>Download</strong>: Netspot for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MacOS</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Android</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> (Free, subscription available)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angry-ip-scanner>3.

It's free, open-source, and available on the three main desktop operating systems: Windows, MacOS, and Linux.</p><p>Unlike many other Wi-Fi scanner software, Angry IP Scanner is neither flashy nor complex. It is rather fast, minimalist, and easy to use. Just download the program, launch it, and press scan. That's pretty much it. But Angry IP Scanner offers a lot more than meets the eye.</p><p>Angry IP Scanner scans a range of IP addresses (you can define the range) rather quickly and automatically provides a trove of information: device MAC address, ping time, host information, and open ports. You can modify the scan in any way you see fit and have the tool generate reports in various formats.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Security professionals use Angry IP Scanner to identify unknown devices connected to a network, perform analysis, and assess potential vulnerabilities. It may not be for everyone, but it's a powerful and unique program.</p><p><strong>Download</strong>: Angry IP Scanner for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MacOS</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Linux</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=acrylic-wi-fi-analyzer>4.

While some other tools could also be useful for that purpose, they can only be purchased separately, which is certainly not for everyone's budget.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can use the Wi-Fi Analyzer for free for up to five days, which should be more than enough if you want just to try it out and run an analysis of your home network. But what can you really do with this program, and how does it compare to other network analysis software?</p><p>Acrylic's Wi-Fi Analyzer is advanced but very intuitive. Boasting a sleek and modern design, its many features make scanning and troubleshooting easy. With this program, you can check network health and security, detect and fix any issues, receive real-time data, see which devices are connected to your Wi-Fi (classify them by type, manufacturer, etc.), save captured data, create reports, and more.</p><p><strong>Download</strong>: Acrylic Wi-Fi Analyzer for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows</a> (Free, subscription available)</p><h2 id=network-analyzer>5.

For additional options, navigate to the menu (via the three little bars in the top left corner). Here, you can access various tools, launch a LAN scan, test your Wi-Fi signal, and more.</p><p>With Network Analyzer, you can also detect all devices connected to an access point and look for any intruders, <a href=#>view their IP addresses</a>, scan ports, get additional network information, and so forth.</p><p>This is a beginner-friendly app, but that doesn't mean it's not suitable for network professionals and IT administrators as well. It offers much more than most of its competitors, and it's free, which is a major advantage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Download</strong>: Network Analyzer for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Android</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> (Free)</p><p>Whether you're a professional or just someone who wants to protect their data better, Wi-Fi analyzers are an indispensable tool you need in your arsenal.</p><p>Hundreds of network analysis programs are on the market, but these five are arguably the best.
