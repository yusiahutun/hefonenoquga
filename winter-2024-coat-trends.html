In New York, you’ll hear fashionable people joke about how they could never leave at least in part because it’s such a coat city."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Nothing can become your personality quite like a coat. Coats were made for main characters because they are main characters. They’re the only wardrobe essential that can completely engulf you with the mysterious air of a cinematic villainess while also swaddling you from the dreadful doldrums of everyday reality.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In New York, you’ll hear fashionable people joke about how they could never leave at least in part because it’s such a coat city. I’ve had friends toy with the idea of relocating to a warmer clime before writing it off completely with the lament “But then I’d never be able to wear my coats!” I myself have found and expressed great joy in the onset of colder weather solely because it means once again I can finally put on my favorite faux fur leopard coat, which makes me feel like Parker Posey in Party Girl shimmying down Houston Street.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Coats: They’re just great! Because what is more fulfilling than the sheer innocuous drama of holding a fluffy lapel to your chest with your hand in a sexy, sleek leather glove, feeling the crisp January air kiss your cheeks? There’s no texture like a good coat, no feeling that can quite compare.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, while coats are timeless and necessary, some particular styles are currently capturing our hearts more than others. Below, the five biggest coat trends of the winter—which we’ll spend the next couple of weeks wearing, and the rest of the year excited to wear again.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>The Return of the Duffle Coat</strong></h2><img alt="a model walks the runway at the prada fashion show during the milan fashion week womenswear fallwinter 20232024 on february 23, 2023 in milan, italy photo estrop by getty images" title="Prada - Runway - Milan Fashion Week Womenswear Fall/Winter 2023/2024" width=3045 height=4569 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prada-toggle-coat-trend-655d2107cd0fb.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Prada</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I remember desperately wanting a fluffy white shearling Miu Miu duffle coat that both Lindsay Lohan and Sienna Miller owned in 2012. I thought I would die without it. Turns out I didn’t, but my desire for it actually did, something I never saw coming. I hadn’t thought about the coat that took over my consciousness and my Tumblr until Prada’s <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/a43061856/prada-fall-2023-review/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Fall 2023 show" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Fall 2023 show</a> in February, when <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/a44651848/kendall-jenner-icons-interview-2023/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kendall Jenner" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Kendall Jenner</a> walked down the runway in a longer, less textured beige iteration with the classic toggle fastenings.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The style has a distinctively twee feeling, with childhood charm. It’s what Paddington Bear wears, after all. But it’s also the kind of coat Alexa Chung would wear while Alex Turner was writing <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj8r3qmOoZ8" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=“Arabella” class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">“Arabella”</a> about her.

Maybe it’s that coats are always shielding us, wrapping us in a mystique we might not naturally possess. Nothing makes you more intrigued by someone than a really good leather or faux fur coat that nearly overtakes them. But if I had to choose one type as particularly vampy and mystifying, it would be the cape coat.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At Saint Laurent, Anthony Vaccarello has been making fabulous cape coats season after season, with material gathering at the shoulders like a soft shield. Italist CEO Diego Abba has also reported an uptick of interest in the style. (As a result, his website currently features over 1,900 to choose from.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Capes make great fall wardrobe staples, because they’re an unexpected silhouette and they’re great temperature regulators,” Abba says. “For transitional seasons, they work well for warmth and ventilation, and can be added to nearly any outfit for a dash of retro glamour.” A dash of wicked sensuality, too.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Coats That Scream “Literally Me”</strong></h2><img alt="paris, france march 07 a model walks the runway during the miu miu ready to wear fallwinter 2023 2024 fashion show as part of the paris fashion week on march 7, 2023 in paris, france photo by victor virgilegamma rapho via getty images" title="Miu Miu - Runway - Fall/Winter 2023-2024 Paris Fashion Week" width=2832 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/miu-miu-winter-runway-655d2122c5718.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">MIU MIU</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With her Fall 2023 collection of oversize tweed blazers worn over gray sweatshirts, with small bags nestled into models’ elbows, Mrs. Prada ushered in a “literally me” fashion era. Everyone saw themselves rushing to run errands in the style, and also realized that maybe there was beauty in the frenzied rush of throwing a bunch of things together. And it was indeed the layering of multiple elements that elevated the otherwise normal—what some might even call boring—separates.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Over the past few months, Abba says, Italist customers have been shopping more and more for outerwear pieces that are easy to wear together, like leather jackets and maxi coats. “We foresee lots of leather outerwear—with shearling trim, combined with other materials, padded and quilted, hooded, and in colors other than black, like cobalt blue,” he says. As for finding the right maxi coat to layer with sweatshirts and hoodies à la Mrs. Prada, he recommends considering length. “Since maxi coats tend to graze the floor, you’ll want to make sure it isn’t too long or too short, and hits at least six inches above your shoes.”</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>A Scarf Coat Evolution</strong></h2><img alt="a person wearing a coat" title="a person wearing a coat" width=872 height=1254 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/scarf-coat-the-row-fw23-655d2185b622f.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">The Row</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This past fall, Toteme’s scarf jacket was the coat heard ’round the world—or at least all over TikTok. Soon after its release and back-to-back sellouts, it was the only coat anyone could talk about. It wasn’t just for you—it was for everyone.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The appeal was obvious. It was a coat that did the layering for you; it was a coat with built-in movement. And now it’s the coat that inspired a dozen others. Not only are more brands attaching scarves to coats, they’re also just reconsidering what the classic coat silhouette is capable of. On Loewe’s most recent runway, Jonathan Anderson showed a coat with leather gathered at one side to form a bag. Apparently, coats that aren’t just coats are the new frontier.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Puffer Coats That’ll Heal Your Inner Child</strong></h2><img alt="a person wearing a red coat" title="a person wearing a red coat" width=2240 height=3360 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sandy-liang-puffer-tie-detail-655d24bb9fed1.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Sandy Liang</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Puffer coats are always the butt of fashion jokes. We get it—they can make you look like a marshmallow or the Michelin Man. And yes, they do remind us of fighting with our moms when we were younger because we didn’t want to be seen in them, no matter how cold it was.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But now plenty of designers are releasing playful iterations of puffer coats that make them more than a mere necessity. Now, they’re actually desirable.
