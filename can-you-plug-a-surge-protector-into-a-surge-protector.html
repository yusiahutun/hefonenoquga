The only additional protection that plugging one surge protector into another could provide is redundancy. That is to say, if the first surge protector happens to fail, the second will still be functional.</p><p>You do not gain the ability to absorb a greater amount of power in the event of a surge. Different surge protectors can trigger at different voltage levels, so the one with the lowest trigger point should trigger first and absorb the excess power.</p><p>There is some evidence to suggest that the protection capabilities of a surge protector can be tampered with if you daisy chain the two devices, and many protector warranties are void if you partake in this practice. That includes any insurance coverage the strip may advertise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=daisy-chaining-power-strips-with-surge-protectors-could-be-dangerous>Daisy Chaining Power Strips With Surge Protectors Could Be Dangerous</h2><p>You've probably been warned not to "daisy chain" <a href=#>power strips</a> before, and that's for good reason. While power strips are far safer than they once were, the more devices you have connected to a single strip, the more likely you are to overload the strip that's closest to the wall outlet.</p><p>A power strip that is carrying a high load or exceeding its rated load may overheat and cause <a href=#>a fire</a>. In some countries (like the U.K.) a fuse would likely blow before the power strip become overloaded. In other countries, there is no fuse to provide such protection.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What's the Difference Between a Power Strip and a Surge Protector?</a></span></p><p><a href=#>Many power strips provide surge protection</a>, and much of the time that's what people think of when the term is used. You can also buy single pass-through sockets that provide surge protection, but even these are rated for a specific load. In many instances, devices that don't use a lot of power (like a <a href=#>phone charger</a>, <a href=#>alarm clock</a>, or <a href=#>bedside lamp</a>) are unlikely to cause an issue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the risk increases when you plug thirstier devices like <a href=#>kettles</a> and <a href=#>heaters</a> into a power strip. If you do plan on plugging one strip into another, make sure that the total power draw doesn't exceed the rating of the strip closest to the wall. You will find this rating printed on the power strip.</p><p>You should also be suspicious of cheap power strips that may not be up to code.</p><h2 id=want-more-protection-use-a-home-surge-suppressor>Want More Protection?
