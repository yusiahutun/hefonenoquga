Even though he had virtually no acting experience, they saw he had huge star potential and would give the solo project enormous publicity." The role eventually went to <a class=hm-link href=#>Alden Ehrenreich, who will star in the film</a> alongside Donald Glover, who will play Lando Calrissian, and actress Emilia Clarke.
