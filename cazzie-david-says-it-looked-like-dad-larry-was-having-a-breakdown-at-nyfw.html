Cazzie also noted that her dad wasn't trying to make people laugh.</p><p>"He would never also do something to try and be funny," she explained. "I don't think he's ever done anything in his life like that to be funny. He's like, 'If you're funny, great, but if you're not funny, don't try to be funny ever.'"</p><p>Cazzie shared that she didn't talk to her dad about the viral moment, but discussed it with her younger sister Romy over text.</p><p>"We were both just like, 'Oy. This is so sad,'" she recalled. "It was simply just too loud for him to be there ... It's very sad."</p><p>Cazzie and Romy, 25, are Larry's two daughters from his marriage to Laurie David, whom he was married to from 1993 to 2007. Larry married TV producer Ashley Underwood last October.</p><a id=gallery-link-08db3f69-1f9b-432f-98e2-80b72ae6b17a class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:08db3f69-1f9b-432f-98e2-80b72ae6b17a data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:71e264dc-7cc7-465e-bab6-32d41f8fff90 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5a/4by3/2021/09/10/5a7ab041e01243debfffefa3cb286339_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j3JmbGhfmK67xsieZJ2Zpp6xbr%2FAsqpmoaRiubC7yp6bZqSZoLJusMCdZKWZoqfGbsPArGShmaaeu6h5wGaZq52RoLGww81mmK1lnq6zuHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
