Merchant, who now stars in Amazon Prime’s Carnival Row, was just 21 when she shot the first pilot episode of HBO’s Game of Thrones in 2009 after being cast as Daenerys Targaryen. But that pilot—along with Merchant’s casting in it—was scrapped. Over a decade later, The Tudors alum, 33, spoke to Entertainment Weekly about being cut from the show and being replaced by actress Emilia Clarke, an experience she now calls “a really great lesson."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Then I found myself naked and afraid in Morocco and riding a horse that was clearly much more excited to be there than I was,” Merchant added, referring to an even racier version of Daenerys’ wedding scene in the original pilot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tamzin-merchant.jpg><p>The&nbsp;Salem&nbsp;actress says that, in hindsight, she “didn’t have any training as an actor,” and she wasn’t “excited” about the role in the first place. “It was a lesson that if my guts are telling me a story isn’t something I’m excited to tell, then I shouldn’t try to be excited just because other people are telling me that I should be excited,” she explained.”</p><p>“I didn’t have any training as an actor, I only have my instincts. And what excites me and what drives me is a compelling story and a compelling character. So for me, Game of Thrones was never that,” she continued.</p><p>As for what else she thinks of the actress who replaced her, Merchant says Emilie Clarke made the role “iconic.” She told EW, “I think it’s a testament to Emilia Clarke for making that role iconic—she was obviously excited to tell that story, and she was epic and excellent. But for me, it wasn’t in my heart to tell it.”</p><p>Merchant also thinks of the Emmy-winning star’s success fondly.&nbsp;“It was kind of funny riding to auditions on buses with Emilia Clarke’s face on it,” she said. “It’s been a thing I felt like I watched unfold and it’s been fantastic for the film industry in Northern Ireland and Croatia, and that has been really great.”</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
