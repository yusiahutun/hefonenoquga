OnlyFans model Alex Le Tissier (daughter in law of footie icon Matt) believes she is being “unfairly punished” for being a sex worker. She had been an ambassador for Southampton Doing It For The Kids for a year and a half but claims she was recently told she is no longer wanted."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I never wanted that to be out in the public.</p><p>“I was also dropped by a football podcast I did every month for the same reasons.

My job has absolutely nothing to do with charity. And I find it disturbing that people want to link my profession with children.</p><p>“I was so proud to be an ambassador and it shows we have a long long long way to go with the stigma we face.”</p><p>In August, the 30-year-old exclusively told us her sex tape with husband Mitch was leaked on the internet.</p><p>It left her fearing for her kids and she described how she “immediately felt sick” after finding out.</p><p>She had decided to <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>join OnlyFans in lockdown after struggling to feed her kids during the pandemic</a>.</p><p>Alex later bagged a job at Babestation but her dramatic switch to sex work resulted in her <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news>claiming Matt Le Tissier had brandished her a “bad mum”</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>Now, writing on Twitter about her latest setback, she said: “I’m disappointed to announce I have been asked to step down as an ambassador for Southampton Doing It For The Kids.</p><p>“I ran over 130 miles in five days, put my body through pain and raised more than £10,000 for two amazing children’s charities last year.</p><p>“Other people's opinions of me based on my chosen career will not change my passion to try to help the less fortunate in the city of Southampton.</p><p>“Whilst I won’t officially be a part of the charity going forward, I’ll continue to support in any way I can, including hosting our annual charity ALT football tournament.</p><p>“I would like to thank Tony and Tracy for giving me that role in the first place.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28216725.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Mum-whose-sex-tape-was-leaked-removed-as-kids-charity-ambassador-despite-raising-£10k.jpg><p>And in a show of support, one mum with two disabled children wrote: “Not many people in society actually care about those with disabilities, and my eldest has faced a fair amount of discrimination due to how severe his autism is.</p><p>“I think it’s disgusting you have raised so much money which families like myself deeply appreciate any help we can get, and they ask you to step down.</p><p>“I’m actually shocked. As a special needs parent we need more people like you that actually care about our children. I wish there were more people like you.”</p><p>Alex also told the Daily Star other parents have contacted her expressing “how upset” they are about the decision.</p><p>And after her sex tape was leaked earlier this year, Alex said: “It is disgusting in my opinion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28216728.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Mum-whose-sex-tape-was-leaked-removed-as-kids-charity-ambassador-despite-raising-£10k.jpg><p>“I know a lot of people will read this and think I've put myself in that position but men and women need to understand the meaning of consent.</p><p>“If you subscribe to my OnlyFans that's a mutual agreement of consent. You are allowed to enjoy those pictures and videos and whatever you purchase for yourself. That doesn’t mean share with the world.</p><p>“No one deserves for their content to be leaked and it’s massively misogynistic. Some cannot stand other people being successful and happy.”</p><p>A statement from Southampton Doing It For The Kids in response to this story read: "Alex was appointed some time ago as an Ambassador of our small charity run by a committee of volunteers, certainly before she entered in to what is referred to as her current "profession", unfortunately over recent months those volunteers have found themselves, for an unreasonable amount of their time, explaining her appointment to those we rely upon for funding, this was due to, what we believed to be, negative exposure on local and national media including but not exclusive to inappropriate comments on social media upon the passing of our late Queen.</p><p>"Communications were entered in to with Alex at the time culminating in the committee requesting she consider stepping down as Ambassador. We take this opportunity to thank Alex for her and Mitch's fund raising referred to as we were beneficiaries of a percentage of the money raised by her charity run.</p><p>"Southampton Doing It For The Kids will continue to focus on providing much needed support to local families facilitated by the fantastic fund raising of committee members, companies and individuals across our city."</p><p><b>READ NEXT:</b></p><ul><li><p><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news><b>OnlyFans OAP, 70, hits back at trolls who call her 'saggy waste of space'</b></a></p></li><li><p><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news><b>OnlyFans star 'tripled earnings' after spending £11k on surgery in Turkey</b></a></p></li><li><p><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news><b>‘I’m an OnlyFans star – people might make fun of my kids but I’ll be driving a Ferrari’</b></a></p></li><li><p><b><i>For more lifestyle stories, <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section>sign up to the free Hot Topics newsletter here</a></i></b></p></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=28141858><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|Image aria-label="Ex-hooligan says away fans must be banned from West Ham and Millwall games to stop chaos" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=28141858><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article27958370.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_JS275449097-1.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28149664.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_hooligans.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=28141858>Ex-hooligan says away fans must be banned from West Ham and Millwall games to stop chaos</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=28140856><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|Image aria-label="OnlyFans mum banned from kids' sport matches has last laugh as she turns millionaire" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=28140856><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article27958371.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS275449095-1.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28140671.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_BANNER-Sara.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=28140856>OnlyFans mum banned from kids' sport matches has last laugh as she turns millionaire</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8Wopq2akaG5cK3Lnq9mpJViwaq%2F0qKcq2WRrbKlecKhmKuhpK56c4SRam1wcGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
