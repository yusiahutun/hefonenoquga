The actress looks nearly unrecognizable for her upcoming role in &#34;Burnt,&#34; where she plays an up-and-coming chef opposite Bradley Cooper.
&#34;I wore no makeup, [shaved] half my head, and gave myself a Little Lord Fauntleroy fringe, tattoos, and piercings,&#34; she tells Marie Claire in her gorgeous October cover story. &#34;I was meant to be quite tough, a female chef in a man's world.&#34;
The 33-year-old star reveals that she's picking grittier roles now as she's learned to focus less on her physical appearance."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"I'm focusing on not having to be glamorous now."</p><p>"You're always replaceable, and in your 20s, they want you to look a certain way," she continues. "Once I turned 30, there was a career shift. In my 20s, I was [playing] the Girlfriend, but now I want to focus on characters, on being a real person."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4e/o/2015/09/16/4e4a2eb0af2150d4a9f60d9f8ab84ca7_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Another big shift in Sienna's life occurred when she had her daughter,<strong> Marlowe</strong>, in 2012. The single mom admits that life with her little one has made her more grounded.</p><p>"[It is] the most profoundly, deeply affecting thing. I didn't feel I had proper roots till I had her; I was whimsical and spontaneous," she declares. "I feel anchored in the way I was looking for, and our life is beautiful and simple. We go to the park; I take her to school; we go to the country and she gets muddy and rides ponies. You try to re-create the magic you remember."​</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e7/o/2015/09/16/e727a540b2075a5496fc44b95d146bbf_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Miller prefers to live a quiet life with her daughter -- away from the paparazzi. In fact, she even took legal action against photographers who were invading her privacy.</p><p>"The paparazzi sat outside my home in London, and everywhere I went, I was followed by 12 cars," she recalls. "It wasn't even safe to take my sister Savannah's kids out. My whole life was documented and manipulated."</p><p>Sienna sued London-based agency Big Pictures in 2008.</p><p>"I thought, 'I've got to put a law in place to make it illegal for people to sit outside my home.' I sought an injunction," she explains.</p><p>Talk about taking a stand!</p><p>Check out Sienna's full interview with Marie Claire on stands September 22.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2JlfnZ7j3Jmam5fqLamus2aZKahnKGys3nBrqmnrF2irrO1xGaapZmZp7Jw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
