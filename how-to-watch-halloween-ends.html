The trilogy is a sequel to 1978’s Halloween, which centered on Michael Myers, a mental sanitarium patient who was committed for murdering his babysitting teenage sister on Halloween night when he was six years old. The film is set 15 years after the murder when Michael escapes the psychiatric hospital and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois, where he stalks Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), a teenage babysitter, and her friends on Halloween night.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>The Halloween sequel trilogy is set 40 years after the original Halloween as Michael returns to Haddonfield and encounters Laurie one last time. Halloween Ends—which marks Curtis and Nick Castle’s final appearances as Laurie Strodes and Michael Myers—concludes the trilogy. “The universal understanding of Laurie Strode is that as this original ‘final girl’ she never gave up, always pushing through no matter what. It is beyond comprehension that that is my legacy,” Curtis told <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> in 2022. “I feel like I haven’t given up, that I have continued to try, but not at the level of Laurie Strode.”</p><p>She continued, “What I’ve gotten from her is way more than she’s gotten from me. Because when I’m gone, her legacy will become mine. Now, of course, I have my children, and that is my life, and that’s crucial. But in the films, she is my legacy, and I could not be prouder of any legacy — unless it’s like Mother Teresa or, you know, a great great Nelson Mandela or somebody like that — but in a film character, there’s not one you could name that I would rather be than Laurie Strode.”</p><p>So where can fans stream Halloween Ends?

But I don’t know necessarily a plan until I’m on set and we’re really engaged in things, no matter how much rehearsal or writing I’ve done. It’s still a vague tapestry until we start really getting in there and weaving it together. So after the success of our 2018 film, we knew where we wanted to go vaguely,” he said. “And I knew that I wanted to center the second film around a lot more action and aggression. And then I wanted the third film to be a love story that felt more grounded and intimate. And so those were always essential ingredients in this, and then trying to figure out how to tell the story of the manifestation of evil.”</p><p>He continued, “The second one is a big Michael Meyers exploitation movie—that’s what Halloween Kills is for me, the opera of Michael Myers. And then two is you’re not going to go into a Michael Myers backstory because as far as I’m concerned, that’s forbidden territory. I don’t want to know his motivation, what inspires him. But I do ask a lot of questions about evil and community that have been left in the aftermath of the Haddonfield massacres. So trying to find a way to ask these questions, but not [doing that] through Michael Myers insisted I bring in a new character to give a perspective of Michael and his behaviors, Laurie and her insights, and then Haddonfield as a whole.”</p><p>He also explained how he wanted the Halloween trilogy to end for Laurie. “I don’t think the Laurie Strode I want to follow is ever going to be 100 percent resolved in any outcome that the story might unfold for her. I felt passionate that we want a story that deals with her struggles and her reflections,” he said. “And so I feel like wherever this movie would take her, on whatever journey, there’s a thoughtfulness to it. And there’s never going to be an absolute definitive, tragic ending, and there’s never going to be an absolute definitive, happy ending. I think it’s a series of tragic events that accumulate in her psyche. And at the end of the day, as we all should when we live through hardships and face difficulties, the thoughtfulness, the reflection, the evolution beyond that is, I think, what’s the most interesting.”</p><p>Green also told AV Club about why he decided to make a sequel to Halloween in 2018 instead of a remake. “That’s a really fun question, and conversation—it’s a big conversation. Because the original Halloween has inspired so many people, and so many people have ripped off ideas or emulated it to the point of cliche or camp. I personally like to select what tropes I invite into it when it’s too little, or too much,” he said. “Turning your back on a bad guy who’s about to pick up a knife? I’m not sure you can get away with a lot of that as much as you used to be able to do without audience groans. I think some of the pacing you need up a little bit for a contemporary audience that may or may not have as much patience as they had 44 years ago.”</p><p>He continued, “And so there are certain stylistic choices we make, but all of it within certainly the appreciation of John [Carpenter] and having him there as a consultant and a collaborator helps me when I get off path a little bit. Sometimes I’ll have a wild idea and say, ‘This is a little wild, John, but what if?’ And he’ll either say, ‘That’s a terrible idea,’ or ‘That’s interesting. See where it takes you.'”</p><p>Halloween Ends is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Peacock</a>.
