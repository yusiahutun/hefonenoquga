We started fantasizing about doing a 1950s Mad Men-style shoot, rollers in the hair, a frilly but perfectly tailored apron and classic home cooking. In reality, the rollers and the silly apron didn’t quite happen, but Liz came over earlier this week (and then our other friends, a couple hours later for dinner) and we had a blast. So please welcome here today our very first smittenkitchen guest photographer, <a href=#>Elizabeth Bick</a>. I suspect you’ll be as wowed by her photos as I am. [Oh, and in case you’re wondering, I do cook everyday in full lip gloss and an apron coordinated with my potholders. I can’t believe you even had to ask!]</p><p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=500 height=332 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2015/05/acorn-squash-quesadillas-tomatillo-salsa1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> A few weeks ago (oh, you didn’t think that meant I was <a href=#>all caught up</a>, did you?) a friend and I went to a cooking demonstration at a great little modern Mexican restaurant named <a href=#>Dos Caminos</a>. I know very close to nothing about Mexican cooking, despite adoring the flavor palate–the sour and tangy citruses against smoky peppers and hearty beans and meats and seriously, I don’t know why it has taken me so long to try to learn a few new things. Chalk it up to intimidation.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=3000 height=2000 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2008/10/twice-baked-shortbread.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> <span>[<strong>Note:</strong> The shortbread got some fresh photos in 2019.]</span><p>I spend much too much time trying to figure out why some recipes we try out burn a hole in my laptop until I can get them up on the site–sometimes, even a day seems too long to keep something from you, like <a href=#>last week’s soup</a>–and why others can linger for months. Sometimes, I’m just not that into them, but don’t want to admit it publicly and perhaps hurt their feelings, or even yours, if you happen to fall for them. Other times, the pictures just came out horrendously, and oh, we all know an ugly-looking recipe is a hard sell (sorry, big-name food magazine whose October cover picture actually convinced me to <i>not</i> buy it).</p><p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=500 height=332 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2015/05/beef-leek-and-barley-soup1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> Seeing as my parents were spending the afternoon at my apartment on Sunday so I could <a href=#>pilfer content for my site from their recipe box</a>, I figured the least I could do was make them some lunch. And although it is not quite soup weather yet, I have not been able to get my mind off of a recipe I read recently, so soup it was.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=640 height=427 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2015/09/moms-apple-cake11.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> My mother makes the best apple cake, and has for as long as I can remember. Big cinnamon-y chunks of apple nestle into a coffee cake I would call “unbelievably” moist, but really, should not be hard to believe considering that my mother is also the one who brought us another of the best cake recipes on this site, <a href=#>The Chocolate Chip Sour Cream Cake</a>. The cake gets better the second day, when the apples juices seep further into the cake and I have seen the conviction of many a chocolate-obsessed/fruit dessert non-believers crumble upon trying a single slice of it. The apple cake, it’s some good stuff.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=640 height=425 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/12/best-challah-egg-bread1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> I only know one Yiddish phrase (well, two, if you can count <i>farshikkert</i>, which is a pretty awesome way to say someone is three sheets to the wind), but conveniently, it is my favorite. <i>A shonda for the goyim</i> means, roughly, that someone of the Jewish faith is not only doing something shameful (shonda), but doing it in front of non-Jews, which of course is an entirely worse offense. Like, it would be bad enough to, say, eat ham and cheese on matzo on Passover (or, I suspect, ever and boy, do I have a great story about that but first let me see if I can get my mother to pay me not to share it) but it would be <i>doubly more awful</i> to do it in front of a person outside your faith. You would, in fact, bring shame upon your entire people, mostly because when given the choice between the most or least dramatic interpretation of an event, I think can safely say that my people will generally opt for the former.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=2560 height=1707 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/majestic-and-moist-honey-cake-12-scaled.jpg alt decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> A few days ago, someone emailed me asking me if I had a recipe for honey cake. You see, honey cake is something traditionally eaten on the Jewish New Year (Rosh Hashanah), which falls next week as eating honey is supposed to encourage a sweet New Year, doubly so if paired with apples.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=500 height=332 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2015/05/balsamic-glazed-sweet-and-sour-cippoline1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> I know it has only been five months since I told you about <a href=#>caramelized shallots</a>, and I would hate for you to think that I have a one-track mind about the diminutive members of the allium family. I use them in other things. For example, I love minced shallots in a salad dressing or tomato sauce, and sometimes I even <a href=#>roast cippoline with tomatoes</a> and pour the juices over garlic-rubbed toast.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=1200 height=797 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2008/09/summers-last-hurrah-panzanella-e1472056230782.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> In the last few days, New York City has gotten the most delicious nip to its breezes; drier air and clear skies have set in and despite that fact that I maintain that I don’t wish summer to end, it’s not holding up when I hit the Greenmarket and go a little berserk over apples and squash and things that have nothing to do with stone fruit. I’m a sucker for New York in the fall.
