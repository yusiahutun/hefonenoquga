Same! What better way to keep your spirits high during these challenging times than by re-inventing your look at all these <a href=#>wig trends of 2021</a>? From sprucing up your look for a virtual meeting to looking your best when running errands for essential items, <a href=# id=auto-tag_wigs data-tag=wigs>wigs</a> should still have a solid place in your heart and your daily routine.</p><p>Though quarantine caused a few hiccups in wig production, it did not stop <a href=#>faux hair</a> aficionados from embracing their units and looking for updated styles to add to their collections. There are so many wig trends on the rise, in unique styles, textures and colors. I predict this year’s wig forecast is going to be curly with a chance of bangs.

Countries such as South Korea experienced a disruption in lace wig production, leaving wig wearers and suppliers turning to creative alternatives. <a href=#>Headband wigs</a> are just one of the types to become popular because of this lace shortage. Like half wigs, headband bangs have zero lace and may require you to leave a portion of your hair out to blend with the wig’s texture. Though a similar concept, headband wigs require much less hair to be left out. You can cover the frontmost part of your hair entirely with the headband or slick down your edges and let your baby hairs be exposed—it’s up to you. Plus, you can use your own headbands if you don’t love the colors and prints that come with your wig.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41NQ+2-yCiL._SL500_.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PLAYFUL-PEYTON-STRAIGHT-CENTER-PART-LACE-LOB-WIG.png><h2>T-Part Wigs</h2><p>Meet lace front wig’s identical but much more simple counterpart: T-Part wigs. At a glance, a T-Part unit offers the same “fake scalp” look of standard lace wigs but with lace that’s only present where the pre-positioned part lies and the hairline of the wig. The minimal lace mimics the letter “T,” hence the name. Lace shortage or not, this is an excellent option for those who are still learning how to master laying a wig. I’m all about less stress and more slaying all 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UNice-Highlight-Wig-Honey-blonde-Piano-Color-Three-Part-Lace-Part-Wig-Straight-Human-Hair-Wigs-150-Density-TL412-Bettyou-Series.png><h2>Chunky Highlights</h2><p>We saw quite the surge in highlights in 2020; however, 2021 is unofficially the year of chunky highlights (again). This hair color trend, which was famously worn by Kelly Clarkson and many other celebs in the early 2000s, is back with a vengeance, and I must say I’m totally *hair* for it. I’m not too sure how long this trend will stick, but thanks to the help of wigs, that’s the least of my worries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Outre-Neesha-Natural-Synthetic-NEESHA.jpg><h2>’90s Inspired Layers</h2><p>Blunt cuts may have had a moment in 2020, but this year is all about layers. Whether you’re rocking a straight look or a curly ‘do, layers add oomph and volume to your look. Layered hair has been the secret weapon of many dynamic divas including Kim Kardashian and Beyonce. Now, it’s time to add the look into your arsenal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41L7mzQN6hL._SL500_.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Liwihas-Brazilian-Straight-Density-Glueless.jpg><h2>Length + Bangs</h2><p>Though the TikTok “BAYANG” challenge in 2020 had us reminiscing on all of the sad bang decisions we made in the earlier part of our lives, bangs are still on the rise in 2021 in a sleeker and hopefully more timeless way. Expect lots of long wigs with bangs and even some curly units sporting the look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Pj5TLFzcL._SL500_.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AISI-HAIR-Shoulder-Synthetic-Resistant.jpg><h2>Texture on Texture</h2><p>Get ready to play with lots of texture this year. We love the sleekness of straight locks, but texture is the ultimate conversation starter, even if it’s just during a zoom video call. Plus, if you’re not that great at using a flatiron or other heated tools, you’ll love the heat-free styling that texture offers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51AmDG0-vUL._SL500_.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/crown-braids-ombre-red-wig.jpg><h2>50 Shades of Red</h2><p>Much like blonde, red is a hair color that will likely never go out of style. In 2021, you can look forward to finding various shades of red wigs ranging from ginger to true cherry red (à la Rihanna circa 2010). From time to time, you may see multiple shades of red blended into one unit for an explosive look made for risk-takers.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/banner-newsletter-beauty_july2020.jpg alt="STYLECASTER | Ashley Benson Interview" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLWitdFmpZqhnKh8cn2Ycmxubl%2Bstqh506ucp5yjZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
