They can instantly transform our same-old go-tos into a fresh, exciting dish. That’s why we were happy to meet bang bang sauce: the condiment that’s spicy, sweet and creamy all in one. This sauce is popular on many restaurant menus and comes in bottled versions too. But it’s yummier if you make it at home to use as a dipping sauce, drizzle or salad dressing to enjoy with your favorite foods. Even better, all you need is five ingredients to whip up this sauce in five minutes. Here’s how to make bang bang sauce and mouthwatering ways to use it as your new go-to condiment!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is bang bang sauce?</h2><p>Bang bang sauce is a condiment mainly consisting of mayonnaise, sweet chili sauce, Sriracha, lime juice and honey. This sauce is believed to have originated from Chinese and Thai cuisine. However, the seafood restaurant chain known as Bonefish Grill is credited with its mainstream rise thanks to a menu item called <a href=# rel=noopener>bang bang shrimp</a>.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How bang bang sauce is different from yum yum sauce</h2><p>This sauce boasts a pinkish orange color that resembles yum yum sauce, another mayo-based condiment containing similar ingredients. But the difference lies in the spice levels due to their varying measurements of each ingredient. While bang bang sauce boasts a combination of flavors, it’s spicier than yum yum sauce, which is sweeter and tangier.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5 ways to use bang bang sauce</h2><p>Bang bang sauce is a condiment that goes well with almost any savory dish. “The beauty of bang bang sauce lies in its versatility” says Chef <a href=# rel=noopener>Daniel P.

Add bang bang sauce to grain or noodle bowls.</h3><p>To give grain or noodle bowls extra flavor, coat the cooked ingredients in the sauce.
