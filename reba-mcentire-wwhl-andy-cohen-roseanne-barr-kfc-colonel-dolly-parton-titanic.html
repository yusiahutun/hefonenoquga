Reba McEntire was all smiles as she recalled Roseanne Barr trashing her take on KFC's Colonel on &#34;Watch What Happens Live.&#34;
The country music superstar and actress also broke down why she had to turn down a role in James Cameron's &#34;Titanic&#34; -- for which she admits some frustration considering what a massive success it turned out to be -- and discusses the possibility of collaborating with Dolly Parton."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"I love Dolly Parton."</p><p>We'll do her one better and say we feel confident in speaking for all of America in saying we'd all love to hear it. They sing at two different pitches, with Dolly coming in higher than Reba, which could just make for some killer harmonies.</p><p>You're talking about two of the strongest female voices in country music of all time. And if the reaction to Dolly singing alongside all of those female powerhouses during the Grammys is any indication, a collaboration of this caliber would be like printing money.</p><p>And the two women have history together, with Dolly standing by to support Reba when she tragically lost almost her entire band and tour manager in a horrific plane crash in 1991. "She called me, she said, You can have my band,'" Reba recalled. "'You take 'em.' And then her bandleader did put a new band together for me."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:91edeb6c-e9be-5c6e-8b5a-e194d9d8d7db data-container-ref=toofab:article:8c7d8c09-3d19-5291-bd58-955a85673996 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/51/5by4/2019/02/21/5127c1bbc4775f25a5cf274066449984_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Paramount Pictures</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Taron Egerton Delivers Flawless Renditions of Elton John's Greatest Hits in 'Rocketman' Trailer</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Now that we're on the subject, we think Dolly Parton would make an iconic Colonel for KFC as well. Reba was a head-turning choice when she made her debut, but their latest Colonel is Peter Weller's Robocop so we're well beyond strange at this point.</p><p>One person who did not like Reba's take on the fast-food mascot at all was Roseanne Barr. But while Roseanne was very upset when she blasted Reba on Twitter, Reba is still laughing about the whole thing.</p><p>Roseanne said that she'd make a better Colonel than Reba and even suggested she doesn't even think Reba eats chicken at all. Reba couldn't help but burst out into laughter just hearing the accusation again.</p><p>"I thought it was hysterical," she said, and clearly still does. "And she might eat more chicken than I do, I don't know."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5eb94d8b-faad-526b-b8e1-d3975926b0cc data-container-ref=toofab:article:8c7d8c09-3d19-5291-bd58-955a85673996 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/23/5by4/2019/01/22/239b747ca99f5ccb8c40abe483e342da_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'The Conners' Ends Its First Season with 3 Shockers -- Including Breakdown Over Roseanne</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Later in the show, Andy and fellow guest Morris Chestnut were challenged with identifying if little factoids about Reba were true or not. We learned that she did not store lipstick in her hair during her "big hair" days, nor does she say "Reba, Reba Chicken Eata" before hitting the stage.</p><p>But she did turn down a role in James Cameron's "Titanic" back in the 1990s. In fact, the role was already hers and she found herself having to walk away from it. Kathy Bates would eventually bring "The Unsinkable" Molly Brown to life in one of her signature performances.</p><p>"We were on tour and I had a lot of people on the payroll and we had these three months already scheduled to do the movie," Reba said, explaining how she had worked the film shoot into her tight touring schedule. "And then they got behind on scheduling and said, 'No we're going to have to move it [to] this time.'"</p><p>That put Reba in a bind, so she had to make a tough decision. "We couldn't reschedule all the arenas and everything," she said. Ultimately, she couldn't bring herself to let her fans down or put her crew out of work so she could go work on a film.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
