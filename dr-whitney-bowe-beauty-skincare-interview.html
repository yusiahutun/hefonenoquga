I formulate them together to work synergistically. I actually test them that way, using clinical testing to show that they work together.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There are a lot of products out there, even the ones that are marketed as very scientific or very clinical, that make certain claims that when you read the fine print, they’re based on ingredient supplier data. Meaning, [the benefits are] based on the individual ingredient. So you’ll see something like “improves the skin barrier,” “improves hydration,” or “improves the microbiome,” but when you do a deeper dive, it’s one particular ingredient that was studied to do that.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">An ingredient is important, but it’s not as important as the final formulation. If you eat two hard-boiled eggs for breakfast, that’s not the same thing as if you eat sugar cookies for breakfast that happen to have two eggs in the recipe. You can’t necessarily extrapolate the claims from one to the other. So if I’m going to make a claim that a product does something, it’s really the final formulation. I take that testing very seriously.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Tell me about the two products you launched with, Bowe Glowe and Bowe Growe.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The key to a successful skin care routine is healthy balanced skin and a healthy balanced gut. Bowe Glowe is a silky, luxurious, dynamic moisturizer. It dives into the skin and is really fast absorbing, so it layers beautifully under skincare in the morning and works really well under makeup. But it’s intensely nourishing, so you can use it as a standalone moisturizer at night too. It’s got prebiotics and postbiotics, ceramides, squalane, and hyaluronic acid. It took me 17 iterations to nail the formulation, because I really wanted to drive those results.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The packaging is what I consider "high-performance sustainable." It's high performance because I want every drop to be potent and active. So this is in an airless pump [to avoid oxidation], and it’s opaque. It’s also sustainable. It’s refillable, [the outside] is recycled glass, [the refill] is PCR plastic. You keep the pump, you keep the outer, and you just change the cartridge.</p><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">Dr. Whitney Bowe Beauty BOWE GLOWE</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$95 at drwhitneybowebeauty.com for BOWE GLOWE" data-href=https://drwhitneybowebeauty.com/products/bowe-glowe data-product-url=https://drwhitneybowebeauty.com/products/bowe-glowe data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrwhitneybowebeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fbowe-glowe" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$95 at drwhitneybowebeauty.com" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://drwhitneybowebeauty.com/products/bowe-glowe data-vars-ga-product-brand="Dr. Whitney Bowe Beauty" data-vars-ga-product-id=6ca42ba1-3f1a-4bf2-9b60-dd1ae1e5c4a1 data-vars-ga-product-price=$95.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=cf9a72d7-9775-4c10-8fc2-a3cfb7dadc71 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category=Europe data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="BOWE GLOWE" title="BOWE GLOWE" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1654633923-220215-dr-whitney-bowe10778-3x4-1654633885.jpg width=1875 height=2500 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">Dr. Whitney Bowe Beauty BOWE GLOWE</h2></p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Credit: NICK STOKES</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="body-h4 css-1fiw57f emevuu60"><strong>What about Bowe Growe?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bowe Growe is a delicious elixir. You actually get enough polyphenols [micronutrients from pomegranate, blackberry, blueberry, black currant, cranberry, and Concord grape] in one dropper, but for flavor purposes, it’s safe to have up to three.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Polyphenols—we know that they act as antioxidants, but the newer science is showing that they actually have prebiotics as well. The gut and the skin are intimately connected. When your gut microbiome is out of balance, it can show up in your skin. Your skin can be dehydrated, you’re more likely to have signs of aging. It's more likely to have sensitivity, stinging, burning. It can exacerbate flares of eczema, acne, rosacea, psoriasis. If you don’t heal your gut lining, you’re sort of always on the defensive. Your skin isn’t able to behave optimally.</p><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">Dr. Whitney Bowe Beauty Bowe Growe</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$49 at drwhitneybowebeauty.com for Bowe Growe" data-href=https://drwhitneybowebeauty.com/products/bowe-growe data-product-url=https://drwhitneybowebeauty.com/products/bowe-growe data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrwhitneybowebeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fbowe-growe" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$49 at drwhitneybowebeauty.com" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://drwhitneybowebeauty.com/products/bowe-growe data-vars-ga-product-brand="Dr. Whitney Bowe Beauty" data-vars-ga-product-id=bf342c8e-5d7f-4b1c-9367-8d6c21baf5dd data-vars-ga-product-price=$49.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=11ec9f1f-d081-4035-8ea3-466c139ff21f data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=Close data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Bowe Growe" title="Bowe Growe" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1654633985-220215-dr-whitney-bowe10779-3x4-1654633961.jpg width=1875 height=2500 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-1e8n84v e1bddzxd0">Dr. Whitney Bowe Beauty Bowe Growe</h2></p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Credit: NICK STOKES</span><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Personally, I’m skeptical about skincare supplements. Convert me!</strong><br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I love healthy skepticism! I think there are some brands that have given supplements a bad name. The quality—you don’t know what you’re getting, and it’s not done in a very evidence-based way. But the science is my North Star when it comes to this stuff.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When I was in training, when I was in my residency, we were taught that diet has no effect on skin. I actually challenged the scientific dogma at the time. I published a groundbreaking study in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology in 2010 called "<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20338665/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Diet and Acne" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Diet and Acne</a>," and I made an argument that when you go from a high-glycemic to a low-glycemic diet, it can benefit acne, and there are certain implications when it comes to dairy as well. And we now have revised our textbooks. Dermatologists now widely accept that nutrition is a part of how we counsel our patients.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I’m talking to gastroenterologists, I’m talking to immunologists. I think it brings a new lens to the supplement world. I don’t know if I know of, off the top of my head, another dietary supplement brand that’s taking their final formulation and doing clinical testing in a third-party laboratory and combining it with a skincare product and measuring those outcomes.</p><img alt="dwb beauty" title="dwb beauty" width=2000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/13-elixir-multiples-0351-final-sq-1654633687.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span></p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Will you see results if you use just one of the products?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I am testing them independently. Independently they are powerful, but together, they work better. Part of that study design was to look at hydration in the skin. I actually measured, again in a clinical study, having people use Bowe Growe every day and Bowe Glowe twice a day, and I tested hydration using a [tool called a] Corneometer. Within the first application of Bowe Glowe and the first dose of Bowe Growe, 100 percent of users saw a statistically significant improvement in hydration. You can’t get that kind of improvement from one product or the other.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>You’re really active on TikTok. Was social media a factor in what you developed?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When I started talking about [the skin-gut-mind connection] on social media, I would recommend a microbiome-friendly diet. I would recommend fermented foods—sauerkraut and kimchi, and lots of sources of prebiotic fiber, like garlic, leeks, dandelion greens. Some people, both in my practice and on social media, would be like, "This is awesome, I feel so much better, my skin looks so much better, my energy levels are up." But I had a significant portion of people who were like, "Dr. Bowe, I can’t tolerate this diet. I’m getting gas, bloating. Practically speaking, I can’t do it."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That was right around the time that the data was coming out around plant-based polyphenols. We have to make it more practical, and that was a big reason why I developed the elixir in this specific format. And [our testing shows] it not only doesn’t cause bloating, but people actually felt like their GI system was running more smoothly. And I wanted to do something that makes you want to drink water.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dr. Whitney Bowe Beauty is available now online at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://drwhitneybowebeauty.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=drwhitneybowebeauty.com class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">drwhitneybowebeauty.com</a>.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p><br>Lindy Segal is a beauty writer and editor.
