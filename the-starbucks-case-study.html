By 1986, the group had six locations in Seattle and had only recently begun selling coffee. By 1989, Starbucks had 46 locations across the Northwest and Midwest, and each year it brewed more than 2,000,000 pounds (907,185 kg) of coffee. Starbucks had 140 locations with $73.5 million in revenue at the time of its first public offering (IPO) on the stock exchange in June 1992, up from $1.3 million in 1987.&nbsp;</p><p>At this stage, the organization’s fair market value was judged to be $271 million. The sale of a 12% stake in the company earned roughly $25 million for the company, resulting in a two-fold increase in the number of outlets over the next two years. Starbucks’ offer cost had risen by 70% to more than double times the income per component of the previous year by September 1992. In July 2013, over 10% of in-store purchases were made via the Starbucks app on customers’ phones.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Starbucks</a> is ranked 132nd on the Fortune 500 list of the largest companies in the United States by revenue as of 2018.
