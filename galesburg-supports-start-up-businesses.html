KCAP manages the front-end of the programs, identifying applicants, as well as working with those applicants to ensure the businesses are ready to launch. The city manages the back-end of the programs, creating funding agreements and managing compliance with the awardees. It is an effective partnership that plays to both organizations’ strengths and has resulted in extensive successful utilization of the programs. &nbsp;</p><p>The Illinois Small Business Development Center (SBDC) is also involved in the process, assisting businesses with the creation of business and marketing plans. SBDC team members have provided advisement to three quarters of all successful awardees to date. &nbsp;</p><p>“The success of these programs is largely thanks to the collaborative partnership between the City, KCAP, and SBDC, as each plays a crucial, but distinctly different, role in creating opportunities for entrepreneurs to successfully launch their business start-ups and grow our economy,” said Mayor Peter Schwartzman. &nbsp;“I’m incredibly proud of how the City has been able to assist so many different new startup businesses over the past year.&nbsp; These businesses are bringing diversity to our community’s business offerings and the programs are helping spotlight new entrepreneurs.“</p><p>The business assistance incentives consist of a portfolio of four grant programs: minority business start-up, south side occupancy, minority business collateral, and urban agriculture pilot program. Awards range from $5,000 – $25,000 for local business start-ups that meet the program criteria. To date, the programs have assisted 18 total businesses, representing an investment of $143,500 in our business community.
