Peta Murgatroyd welcomed her first child with fiancé — and Dancing With the Stars co-star — Maksim Chmerkovskiy earlier this month, but she's already getting candid about her post-baby body. The dancing pro took to Instagram to shatter all the unrealistic expectations women have about how their bodies are supposed to look after giving birth — by sharing photo of her own belly.
“Real life: I took this photo eight days post birth,” the new mom wrote on Instagram."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Many people think a woman should shrink right back to her pre-birth weight immediately. That is just not the truth for most.”</p><p>She bravely bared her body in the sideways mirror selfie, wearing just a bra and black leggings. Her stomach was protruding and it looked swollen just one week after birth to her son, <strong>Shai Aleksander Chmerkovski</strong>. Peta also offered her support to new mothers who feel pressure to lose their baby weight fast.</p><p><a href=#>MORE: Blake Lively Shows Off Her Post-Baby Body on the Red Carpet — See the Pics!</a></p><p>“The female body is incredible and resilient, but healing and strengthening take time. Now it's time for patience and hard work. Lots of love to all the new mamas out there on the journey,” the 30-year-old continued, and added that her newborn baby boy is “worth every pound” in a hashtag.</p><p>Fans left words of encouragement on the new mom’s Instagram post, calling Peta an inspiration. Another user, who is a mom-of-four, offered her own advice and told Peta to take her time getting her body back. Others thanked Peta for being honest about her post-baby body.</p><p><a href=#>MORE: Soleil Moon Frye Sheds 26 Pounds on Nutrisystem After Welcoming Baby No. 4 — See Her Stunning Weight Loss Pics!</a></p><p>But it seems like she isn’t too worried about losing her post-baby weight — she’s too busy enjoying motherhood!
