So it is perhaps unsurprising that he put his talents to good use ahead of his marriage to the then-Princess Elizabeth in 1947. The Duke presented his bride-to-be with a stunning diamond bracelet that held great personal sentimental value. It has come to be known as 'The Queen's Wedding Bracelet' and is among the most treasured of the jewels in Her Majesty's collection.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=eGsJ98JSODHL style=text-align:center data-wc=9><strong>WATCH: Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip's 1947 wedding</strong></p><p id=e4r1yTDYdnOx data-wc=89>The diamonds used in the bracelet came from an exquisite tiara owned by Philip's mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg. She gave it to her son to create some jewellery for his soon-to-be fiancée; Elizabeth's striking engagement ring contained diamonds from the tiara - a three carat diamond solitare with five smaller diamonds on either side. The Duke then used the remaining jewels to personally design an Art Deco-style bracelet for his bride, which was crafted by London jeweller Philip Antrobus and presented to the Princess on her wedding day.</p><p id=extAY5n3Mj6f data-wc=13><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Witty Prince Philip surprises reporter live on air in hilarious unearthed video</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0a33766402da-queen-wedding-bracelet-z.jpg><p id=evpkJJcDZ3UO style=text-align:center data-wc=12><strong>The Queen has worn her wedding bracelet on a number of occasions</strong></p><p id=ed4d7NF8t6K9 data-wc=47>Other gifts received by the bride included a 19th-century necklace of diamonds and sapphires given to her by her father, King George VI, and a diamond and ruby necklace from her mother, Queen Elizabeth.
