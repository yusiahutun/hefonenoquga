The coronavirus pandemic has upended many people’s schedules, including those of Du and her banker husband, who planned to move to Europe in the summer of 2021.
While they remain in Hong Kong with its tough restrictions on international travel, Du has spent the past year remotely launching the Asymmetry Art Foundation in London."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They select art and interpret it, often in a quiet, scholarly tone. But they are the ones who shape how we see art and plant ideas in our heads, and certainly deserve more support in these divisive times, Du says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her first encounter with art was traditional and highly regimented.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Millennials aim to change perceptions of contemporary Chinese art</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Like many conservative parents in China, mine thought I had talent and sent me to a specialist secondary school for artists.

Nothing is perfect. Beauty is something between perfect and imperfection. Whereas everyone is chasing 100 per cent, and believes in black and white, I think imbalance is just how the world is. That’s why I like art to be radical and challenging, not beautiful,” she says.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">I want to help Hong Kong continue to improve its cultural standingMichèle Ruo Yi Landolt, deputy director of the Asymmetry Art Foundation</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The foundation sets up scholarships for curators, serves as a networking hub with an archive of research material, and will soon have a permanent physical home in the British capital.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It has just established two postdoctoral fellowships, a lecture series and an annual symposium at The Courtauld Institute of Art, a college of the University of London specialising in the study of the history of art and conservation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a first for one of the top centres of art historical research in the world, there will be a dedicated programme for contemporary art in Chinese-speaking regions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/12/b43b8060-1736-453b-936e-43ec368b24d9_ea94c24a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Prior to that, Asymmetry had in the space of several months set up other research fellowships with Goldsmiths, University of London – a research institution whose remit includes the arts and design – Whitechapel Gallery, the Delfina Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to facilitating artistic exchange, and the Chisenhale Gallery, a non-profit contemporary art gallery based in London’s East End.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Michèle Ruo Yi Landolt, the foundation’s director based in London, says it aims to maintain long-term relationships with its fellows.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are a mediator and we will recommend our fellows and help them find the next opportunity,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The foundation’s main aim is to facilitate global exchanges, the two women say. “We see Chinese monetary power, we see many Chinese wanting to buy art. But we think about the gap of research, and we want to help fill that,” says Du.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/12/6a947a3e-b490-48eb-a54f-7bcd2f7c4365_a867dfc1.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite Brexit, London remains a good location for that kind of exchange, adds Landolt, who is of mixed Chinese and Swiss heritage and grew up in Beijing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is international and has a very developed institutional landscape that we have latched on to,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the foundation will always have one foot planted in Asia, since it wants to see curatorial fellows use their knowledge there.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There is one Hong Kong curator who is joining our fellowship, and I want to help Hong Kong continue to improve its cultural standing,” Landolt says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Du says she didn’t choose London over Hong Kong as the base of the foundation because of the introduction of the National Security Law, which has curbed freedom of expression in Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That’s not the reason. Beijing, Hong Kong and London are all my homes. I want to contribute [to each one]. I have spent two years full time in Hong Kong without travelling and I have enjoyed my time so much with Hong Kong friends and institutions, and I am very grateful and happy.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Correction: A previous version of the story said there were two Hong Kong curators in the Asymmetry Fellowship programme.
