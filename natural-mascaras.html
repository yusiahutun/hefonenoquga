“Natural doesn’t mean safe,” said Charlie Denton, founder of beauty and skincare brand Crop Natural. “If you want something that performs and is safe for you, ask people who know – do the research before you purchase."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

For instance, a majority of manufacturers are still utilizing parabens or preservatives that can disrupt estrogen growth, and propylene glycol–an ingredient that causes skin irritation–in their mascara. With that being said, a feasible approach to transitioning your products is to start with just one.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I think this is a major thing people should understand – and need to really look at: Women put on an average of 168 different chemicals on their bodies per day,” said Denton. “Think about that – all exposures add up. Exposing yourself daily to harsh synthetics or chemicals will have lasting impacts on the skin.” For that reason,&nbsp;</span><span>Crop Natural’s first mascara, is made from castor oil, jojoba oil and Brazilian palm wax.</span></p><p><span>As of late, more organic and vegan makeup brands are looking to oils as an alternative to traditional mascara ingredients. Not only are they safe to put in your body, but they are beneficial to put on your body. Plus, there are a few oils that can be particularly beneficial to your lashes.</span></p><h2><b>Castor Oil</b></h2><p><span>Castor oil is a vegetable oil, typically used in food…remember our rule of thumb? It’s naturally moisturizing and strengthening to hair, and functions best as a conditioner.</span></p><p><span>“Castor oil specifically repairs the lashes and is a great oil for elongating and stimulating growth and recovery within the lash follicles,” Denton said. Legend has it that Cleopatra actually used castor oil to brighten her eyes, so why not try it to luster up your lashes?</span></p><h2><b>Jojoba Oil</b></h2><p><span>The Jojoba plant is a shrub that grows in the desert, most commonly found in the southwestern United States. If there’s anything we can rely on from lifeforms that flourish in the desert, it’s their hydrating qualities. Jojoba oil is actually a wax that comes from the plant. It can be found in many foods, and was first introduced to cosmetics in the 1970s. And there is a good reason we’re still using it almost five decades later: the ingredient is moisturizing, protects against breakage and is rich in vitamins that naturally nourish hair and promote thickness.</span></p><h2><b>CBD Oil</b></h2><p><span>The most “radical” of all of the mascara oils, CBD oil is the most recent to be introduced to our lashes. Using CBD oil in your mascara won’t get you high. It does come from the cannabis plant, but it’s a different strain from THC, which is what you find in marijuana. A mascara made with CBD oil will give you high volume, as the oil brings a creamy texture and conditioning elements to a mascara.</span></p><h2><b>Argan Oil</b></h2><p><span>A miraculous work of nature, argan oil comes from the argan nut, which is typically found in Morocco. It is rich in everything that is good for you and for hair: fatty acids, antioxidants and vitamin E. The oil’s hydrating and growth-stimulating properties make it every eyelash’s dream. &nbsp;Aptly called “liquid gold,” argan oil can actually help your lashes grow longer.</span></p><p><span>Ready to nourish your lashes with some healthy oils and add natural volume?
