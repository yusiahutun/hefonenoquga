Conservative dress that defined <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the 1950s</a> gave way to dressing as a form of self-expression. Maxi hemlines were replaced by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>mini skirts</a> and closed-toe kitten heels by tall boots. People started reaching for more vibrant color palettes and began to play with prints. And today, '60s fashion is seeing a revival among celebrities and the fashion set. According to stylists, the 2.0 version embraces its predecessor, favoring eye-catching looks, but with its own modern twist.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep scrolling for '60s fashion trends that are seeing a revival.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We don't know about you, but after years of living in nothing but&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>athleisure</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>loungewear</a>, we can't wait to step outside my cozy comfort zone. Who knew baggy sweats could feel so restrictive? Although a pair of leggings isn't quite the same as a poodle skirt and pearls combo, transitioning to mod styles, like mini skirts and sleeveless dresses, sounds ideal — and we imagine that people of the '60s felt similarly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to California-based celebrity stylist&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Heathyr Wolfe</a>, we're not the only ones itching to switch up my style and adopt '60s fashion trends.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The '60s was a playful era, kicking the conservative '50s to the curb and letting people have more freedom," Wolfe tells&nbsp;InStyle. "After years of being in conservative clothing, we want to be playful in our wardrobes again."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fast forward to the present, and the fashion stylings of the 1960s feel almost like a kind of escapist way of dressing, not unlike mood-board trends like&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cottagecore</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>regencycore</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>fairycore</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>balletcore</a>. But unlike in the 1950s and '80s, where one particular style dominated the entire decade, the 1960s encompasses all kinds of aesthetics, from hippie to Mod, Youthquake (more spirited, sexy, and pop culture-inspired styles), and rock glamour.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There were so many cool trends in the '60s, with fashion icons like Audrey Hepburn, Twiggy, Jackie O, and Bridgette Bardot leading the way," celebrity stylist and costume designer,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Candice Lambert</a>&nbsp;tells&nbsp;InStyle. And while you can (and absolutely should) look back on these icons' styles for outfit ideas, McAndrews also recommends looking to celebrities like&nbsp;Ariana Grande,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Anya Taylor-Joy</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Gigi Hadid</a>&nbsp;for modern-day takes on 1960s fashion.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Ariana Grande as of late has really been serving '60s looks with her miniskirts and go-go boots, her ponytail with a bump, and that '60s eyeliner," says Lambert. At the Venice Film Festival, Anya Taylor-Joy gave off serious '60s fashion vibes with her pink pillbox hat, she adds. As for&nbsp;Gigi Hadid at the Met Gala, she was "the epitome of a '60s Queen."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another fashionista toying with '60s trends is&nbsp;Ciara. Fashion expert and celebrity stylist&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Cindy Conroy</a>&nbsp;tells&nbsp;InStyle&nbsp;Ciara's latest onslaught of tigress leopard print dresses is essentially serving us '60s fashion on a silver platter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"From her cascading Roberto Cavalli gown at the Billboard Women in Music event to her recent vacay selections and short, flirty minidress while on vacation with Russell Wilson In St. Barts, chalk it up to nostalgia," Conroy says. But these sexy yet vintage-inspired looks "are the fashion world's way of flipping the script."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So how can you incorporate '60s fashion trends into your own day-to-day wardrobe? Well, the good news is, there are plenty of options to choose from. For example, Wolfe's go-to '60s fit is a mini dress from&nbsp;Courrèges&nbsp;or a psychedelic shift from&nbsp;Trina Turk, while Lambert shared she recently bought a&nbsp;Maximilian cutout black dress&nbsp;and paired it with&nbsp;YSL go-go boots. Conroy loves a super leggy look, complete with a metallic micro mini skirt, a checked wool coat, and gold knee-high boots. "I add a Jackie O-approved pillbox hat for even more '60s renaissance, but with a neon twist," she says.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From loud animal prints to a subtle bandana headscarf accessory, thigh-skimming skirt suits to psychedelic prints and mod leather, whichever '60s fashion aesthetic you choose to channel, give it your own&nbsp;personal style spin&nbsp;and it's sure to be outta sight.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ykuM6tn6Kml2SDcb%2BMn5isoJmkuw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
