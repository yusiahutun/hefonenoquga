They exchanged vows on September 14, 2013, at the gorgeous Villa Pizzo, with stunning views of the landscape in the background. On the big day itself, Stevie Wonder and the groom himself, treated guests to live <a href=#>music</a> performances. You wouldn’t expect anything less.</p><p>Not only that, but Chrissy wore <a href=#>three bridal dresses</a> on the day, designed by Vera Wang.</p><p>Casting your minds back to 2007, the pair met on the set of John’s music video Stereo. After four years, he got down on one knee and asked the all-important question during Christmas in the Maldives. The proposal took place on the beach, oozing romance and Disney fairytales.</p><p>The wedding took place at the popular hotspot for a lot of <a href=#>Hollywood</a> stars. George Clooney and his wife Amal also chose that location. They know luxury <a href=#>real estate</a> to a tee.</p><p>Chrissy shared some of the moments from the nuptials on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-saying-i-do-again>Saying ‘I do’ – again</h2><p>Why have just one wedding with Chrissy Teigen and John Legend when you can have two?

This time around, they decided to say something new, and not to recite the same ones as the first occasion.</p><p>“We were like, well, we’re gonna rewrite them and say them because I have a big hang-up that I didn’t write my own vows [at our wedding], because I was so nervous and just insecure and stuff so I didn’t,” she said.</p><p>“So that’s been like a big regret of mine. So if anything it was a chance to redo it and be with people we love, and it worked.”</p><p>And, kids being kids, they apparently were “still disgusted” by the couple. They wanted to plug their ears.</p><p><strong>For immediate grief support, call 1-800-221-7437 First Candle. Counselors are available 24/7.
