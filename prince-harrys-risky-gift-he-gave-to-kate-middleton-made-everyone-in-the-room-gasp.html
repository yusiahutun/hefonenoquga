The former royal who has always had a cheery personality decided to play a prank on the blushing bride <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> that would leave the room gasping.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-1298572702-1024x737.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-pulled-out-a-thong-at-kate-and-william-s-wedding>Prince Harry pulled out a thong at Kate and William’s wedding</h2><p>In his 2023 memoir Spare, the Duke revealed he had pulled out a thong in front of the whole room to give to Kate during her wedding with William. He revealed how an American man wanted to make something special for the new Princess of Wales (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">per</a> The Sun).</p><p>The man had “set out to catch 1,000 ermines” but only caught two, Harry notes in his book. The American then turned that into a thong with silk strings. “Still, I added, the Yank improvised, made the best of things, as Yanks do, and cobbled together what he had, which I now held aloft,” he says in Spare.</p><p>“The room let out a collective gasp,” <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a>‘s husband says before revealing what the man had patched together was a thong. “Soft, furry, a few silken strings attached to a V-shaped ermine pouch no larger than the ring pouch inside my tunic,” the now 38-year-old detailed. After the collective gasp, the room broke out into laughter. After pulling a little prank on Kate and everyone, the Prince’s speech took a more serious turn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-113267965-1024x917.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-remembered-mother-diana-at-waleses-wedding>Harry remembered mother Diana at Waleses wedding</h2><p>When the laughter died, the then 26-year-old Harry remembered his mother <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>. He noted how she would have loved being there on William’s special day.</p><p><a href=#>King Charles</a>‘ second bron also shared how she would have loved Kate.</p><p>“Mummy: How she’d have loved to have been here. How she’d have loved Kate, and how she’d have loved seeing this love you’ve found together.”</p><p>Princess Diana passed away 13 years before William and Kate tied the knot.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kate-faced-another-mortifying-prank-at-summer-job-as-a-teen>Kate faced another mortifying prank at summer job as a teen</h2><p>Before starting her academic life at St Andrews University where she met Prince William, Kate took up a summer job to earn some extra cash.</p><p>According to Kate: The Future Queen by Katie Nicholl (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via</a> Mirror), Kate took up a job as a deckhand for a fleet of Challenger yachts in Southampton.</p><p>However, her time at the job was quite eventful. One time her coworkers played a prank at her expense that left her flushed and angry. Kate’s coworkers filled a life jacket with a bunch of condoms. Then when was showing the vessel’s life jackets to guests, she pulled the toggle and a bunch of condoms fell out of it in front of the guests.</p><p>The Princess was “mortified and very embarrassed.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2Z%2FcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2Kxkq6GjoMZus8ifq2aglWK0osLEZquoZZuWwaZ5zKKbnaSVqbyvecyam55llauys8XOp5xmoZ5iwamxjKumqKVdnK60vI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
