In October, the 52-year-old confessed that she and Will had actually been <a href=#>“living separate lives” since 2016</a>.</p><p>In an interview with Today, before the release of her memoir Worthy, Jada revealed that although they didn’t actually divorce on paper, it still ‘was a divorce’. However, they still remained legally married.</p><p>It now seems like the Oscars changed everything between the two. “After all those years trying to figure out if I would leave Will’s side, it took that slap for me to see I will never leave him,” she said in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a> with The Daily Mail.</p><p>“Who knows where our relationship would be if that hadn’t happened?” she questioned.</p><p>She also claims that she almost didn’t attend the <a href=#>Award Show</a>, however is now “glad she did”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1239559387-1024x726.jpg><p>The couple spent Thanksgiving together with their children, as they took to <a href=#>Instagram</a> to share some adorable family photos.</p><p>Will could even be seen kissing Jada’s forehead in one pic, and fans just couldn’t keep up with where they stood with one another.</p><p>“Will is like that friend that you’re tired of giving advice to,” joked one.</p><p>However, it looks like Jada has now cleared everything up once and for all. It’s been a ride, but it looks like the Smiths are here to stay.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2Z9cLbAnZhmqJmjuKbA02aqpqGknXqiuMyoqq1llJ6xr8CMmqutnZ6ZerW0xGamrJuRp8BusdWepa1lpJ2utXnSmq2enF2dsrN5zJqpq6GRnLJw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
