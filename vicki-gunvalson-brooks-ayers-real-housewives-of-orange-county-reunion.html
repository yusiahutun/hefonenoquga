On the final installment of Bravo's &#34;Real Housewives of Orange County&#34; three-part reunion, Vicki Gunvalson finally confessed  that she doesn't think hr ex Brooks Ayers has cancer.
All season long, the ladies have questioned Ayers' diagnosis -- from his questionable treatments to his seemingly-phony PET-CT scan, Brooks' cancer has been a hot topic. Now Vicki -- who said earlier in the reunion that she and Ayers have officially split -- is revealing whether or not she thinks he has the disease."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Now Vicki -- who said earlier in the reunion that she and Ayers have officially split -- is revealing whether or not she thinks he has the disease.</p><p>When asked by costar <strong>Tamra Judge</strong> what her "gut" tells her about the situation, the OG of the OC got extremely candid.</p><p>"I don't have any definitive documentation that he doesn't have cancer," she said, before Tamra asked Gunvalson what she really thought. "My gut says he doesn't have it," she finally confessed.</p><p>"Why did you drag us all through this?" costar <strong>Shannon Beador</strong> asked. "This has only happened in the last month ... because I am seeing all this stuff and how he has acted in the last two months," Vicki added.</p><p>Tamra continued to grill Vicki, asking when she "figured out" he didn't have cancer.</p><p>"I would say probably three months ago that I really questioned him and said to him, 'This is not making sense. Why won't you give me your report?'" she said.</p><p>"And he kept telling me, 'You have no right to take the reports because you're going to bring them to the women.' I said I need more proof than what you've given me," she revealed.</p><p>Vicki's confession comes on the heels of <strong><a href=#>allegations made by her daughter Briana</a></strong>, alleging that Brooks tried to hit on her when she was pregnant.</p><p>What do you think about Vicki's shocking statements?
