The tune is a little bit off the beaten path for the normally fun-loving, rocking foursome.

But in this one, real-life husband and wife Fairchild and Westbrook open up about relationship that's slowly growing apart, which theirs certainly isn't.</p><p>"When we wrote this song with Lori McKenna, we didn't know it was going to be a duet. We wrote it from one person's perspective," Fairchild tells&nbsp;<a href=#>CMT</a>. "It was on accident that it became a duet."</p><p>Fairchild explains that she and Westbrook were playing around with the 'Your Side of the Bed' lyrics and melody at home, and they were surprised at how great the tune sounded as a duet.</p><p>"Clearly, Jimi and I live together, so when we were brainstorming on what should go on the record and what shouldn't, we were going through that song," she adds. "There were just the two of us in the kitchen and we were like, 'Man, that makes a cool duet!'"</p><p>The musical couple make the 'Your Side of the Bed' lyrics sound so believable that when they recorded it in the studio, someone tearfully asked them if their marriage was okay.</p><p>"Staring at the ceiling, lying here all alone /&nbsp;I said a prayer for you then I said one of my own /&nbsp;But you don't reach for me, when you lie down quietly," are the kind of heart-wrenching lines that brought Fairchild and Westbrook's marriage into question.</p><p>From there, the chorus of the song only gets more intense, as the LBT members sing: "Tell me how, how'd you get so far away? /&nbsp;All we have left are the memories of the love we made /&nbsp;Are you sleeping with your own regret? /&nbsp;On your side of the bed."</p><p>'Your Side of the Bed' is emotionally hard-hitting compared to Little Big Town's fun anthems like 'Pontoon' and 'Tornado.' But after gaining plenty of fans for their country-pop hits, it seems like LBT were ready to release something a little more serious.</p><p>"I have hopes for this song with the fans because 'Pontoon' has been fun and 'Tornado' has been this anthemic, I'm-gonna-rip-your-house-down song," Fairchild points out. "But this is about real life, living and the emotional connection we have with the fans when we sing it."</p><p>So far, it seems that country music critics are digging LBT's serious side. The song has received plenty of positive reviews (including <a href=#>ours</a>), and it debuted in the Top 50 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts.</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Listen to Little Big Town, 'Your Side of the Bed'</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpaGkqbmmecGinmasn6y7bsXOrqlmq5mZsm67xWaroZ1dl7KlecuyqaKbo2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
