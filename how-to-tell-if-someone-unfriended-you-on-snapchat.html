If you can’t find the person you’re looking for—and you know you used to be friends with them on Snapchat—they have either unfriended you, blocked you, or deleted their own account.</p><p>To check that list, open the Snapchat app on your iPhone or Android device. In the top-left corner, tap your profile picture or Bitmoji.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1-snapchat-profile.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On your profile page, scroll down a bit and select “My Friends.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2-snapchat-my-friends.png><p>On the “My Friends” page, you’ll see a list of all your current Snapchat friends. If someone isn’t on this list and you know you used to be Snapchat friends, it means they’ve unfriended you, blocked you, or deleted their Snapchat account.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3-snapchat-see-friends.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now try searching for that person to add them as a new Snapchat friend. If they show up for you to add them again, that means they’ve unfriended you. If you can’t find them anymore, it means <a href=#>they’ve blocked you on Snapchat</a> or <a href=#>deleted their Snapchat account</a>.</p><h2 id=faqs>FAQs</h2><h3 id=does-snapchat-notify-you-when-you-get-unfriended>Does Snapchat notify you when you get unfriended?</h3><p>No, Snapchat doesn’t notify when someone unfriends you. However, you can find out who has removed you by checking to see if they’re still in your friends list.</p><h3 id=can-you-re-add-a-snapchat-friend-who-removed-you>Can you re-add a Snapchat friend who removed you?</h3><p>Yes, you can add someone back as a friend even if they’ve unfriended you. You can do that by opening Snapchat, tapping the “Add Friends” option, finding the person you want to add, and hitting “Add” next to their username.</p><h3 id=what-rsquo-s-the-difference-between-unfriending-and-blocking-someone-on-snapchat>What’s the difference between unfriending and blocking someone on Snapchat?</h3><p>When someone unfriends you on Snapchat, you can still see their profile and even add them as a friend again. However, when someone blocks you on Snapchat, you can’t see their profile anymore, nor can you add them as a friend. They’re basically non-existent for you on the platform. Similarly, if you <a href=#>block someone else on Snapchat</a>, you’ll disappear for them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=why-did-someone-disappear-from-my-snapchat-friends-list>Why did someone disappear from my Snapchat friends list?</h3><p>People will disappear from your Snapchat friends list for one of three reasons: they unfriended you, they blocked you, or they deleted their own Snapchat account.</p><h3 id=what-does-an-x-mean-next-to-a-snapchat-friend>What does an X mean next to a Snapchat friend?</h3><p>An “X” next to a person’s name in Snapchat can have different meanings. In some cases, it appears because you have yet to accept or decline that person’s friend request. Other times, you can tap “X” to dismiss a friend suggestion in the “Quick Add” section.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGifqK9dqbxuwMSlo2ahlmLAsLnEqKWeZaWjs7O1xKebnpxdrry2ec6nZKymkaWwqa3TaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
