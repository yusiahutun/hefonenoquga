At a time when concepts such as etiquette and propriety seem to be going by the wayside, Santo Domingo is one of those rare modern-day society swans who actually believe in them, while also understanding that they need to be adapted to how people live in the 21st century."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So I wanted to ... take out all the guesswork and all the uncertainty,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We want people to know that with everything that we offer they can confidently set the most beautiful table, however you’re putting it together and adding your own style and flowers and making it personal.

While Tiffany is mainly known as a jeweller, the brand has been making homeware since its early days. Indeed, that as soon as her appointment was made public, friends and acquaintances started showing Santo Domingo photos of old Tiffany homeware collections, some belonging to their mothers and grandmothers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Tiffany really is a part of people’s lives for all these important milestones – graduation, first child, engagement, wedding, the holidays – and this is an extension of all those memories being created, of those dinners and occasions, and being a part of the best moments of your life and creating these collections that can be embedded in our memories and personal history and tradition.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/27/b85122b5-c76a-43ca-b66a-33f3a7ad9448_a8d83a63.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Santo Domingo loves the newness of fashion, she is also drawn to pieces that stand the test of time and can be passed down from generation to generation. For her first Tiffany collections, she updated archival prints and re-created them in colours inspired by gemstones. She also revisited the brand’s signature T pattern, to create classics that can work both in a country home or in a more formal setting. “What’s most important is being mindful of what the lifestyle of today’s consumers is and speaking to how they entertain. We wanted to create these core collections that speak to the legacy of the house and have patterns that can stand the test of time and are truly iconic,” she says.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Why genderless pieces are high jewellery’s next frontier</span></p></a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/27/6467c47b-701e-4469-89e1-bd33995772ec_77a123d8.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As a long-time customer and lover of all things Tiffany, Santo Domingo is well aware of the codes of the house but she’s also ready to shake things up while staying true to the chic and refined aesthetic at the heart of who she is and what she does.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“People in fashion and creative fields are always talking about taste or an eye. Are you born with it or not? I don’t know if there’s an answer but I think it’s important to grow and always train your eye and see new things,” she says. “At the end of the day, it comes down to having confidence in your taste and point of view and what you can bring to something.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZqedp6h6tb7Ep5usZ5Gnwaqvy55mbGpiZ312gY6wn7JlnJbCs7HNZqqapqSkeqW7zKKloKddrK60ecCwnKysoqqwrHnJqKCnZaSes6etzbJkoaedmnqqusKopKKml2Kus8DIrKuim12ZtrOxwq2mq2Wgp7yutdKeqmaaop67qA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
