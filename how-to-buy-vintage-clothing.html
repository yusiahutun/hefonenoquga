Here, the fashion forager offers insider tips on how to buy vintage clothing like a pro, and score killer high-style finds.</p><p><strong>Firstly: Know the difference between vintage and thrift</strong><br>What is it that sets vintage clothing apart from simply used items? Raymond explains: “You can find great vintage items in thrift stores, but you shouldn’t find obvious thrift items in a vintage store. Vintage denotes something special—that an item has stood the test of time and has proven to remain relevant for any number of reasons—timelessness of style, [quality], historical or cultural significance or interesting provenance.”</p><p>A few&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;things to keep in mind: Signs that a&nbsp;garment was manufactured before the mid-’60s are metal zippers, side-snap closures, saw-toothed edges (often known as pinked seams), and union labels printed in blue.</p><p><strong>Start with a classic</strong><br>If you’re a neophyte when it comes to vintage hunting, it’s worth seeking out something timeless to start. “A good first piece of vintage for the newly initiated is something basic and classic,” says Raymond. “Perhaps a 1950s beaded cardigan or a 1960s little black dress. Make it something you can wear over and over again that won’t lose its luster right away.”</p><p><strong>It’s not size that matters, but undergarments</strong><br>Often with vintage, it’s not the size but the undergarments that truly make a piece fit correctly. “Sizing standards have changed through the decades, but not as much as ladies undergarments have,” says Raymond. “Every era of the 20th century has a distinct silhouette&nbsp;that required specific shape-shifting garments—from corsets to girdles to bullet bras and beyond.”</p><p>This means a specific vintage garment might not look the same today without a specific undergarment, so its worth noting that before you buy.</p><p><strong>Know your eras</strong><br>“Typically the easiest eras to shop would be the ones closest to now. There would naturally be more of an abundance to choose from,” Raymond says.</p><p>“The easiest eras to fit into a contemporary wardrobe would be the those eras from the latter half of the 20th century (1960s on).&nbsp;Items from before that might be considered too costume-y if not incorporated well into your personal style.”</p><p><strong>Why buy vintage vs. new</strong><br>A quality vintage garment or&nbsp;accessory&nbsp;can cost as much as current couture (ahem, vintage <a href=# id=auto-tag_chanel data-tag=chanel>Chanel</a>) so why would someone choose a pre-owned item over&nbsp;something&nbsp;brand new? Because it’s probably made better. “A general rule of thumb, especially for higher-end designer pieces, is that the older the piece the higher the quality,” Raymond explains.</p><p>“There is usually more handwork, more attention to detail and a tendency for durability that you don’t see much any more in contemporary fashion.” Not to&nbsp;mention&nbsp;that—with a vintage designer item—you&nbsp;likely&nbsp;won’t spot any other gal on the street carrying that same bag or wearing that same jacket.</p><p><strong>Do your research if you’re looking to spend</strong><br>That said, Raymond warns against splurging without doing a good deal of research first. “I wouldn’t recommend investing a great deal of money on anything you might buy on a whim. Learn how to spot condition issues, what eras work for you and how collectable an item is before you jump in,” Raymond advises.&nbsp;“Vintage fashion as an investment is best left to the truly educated. It’s important to know how to recognize and identify the signs that may make an item valuable and collectable. You should be well versed on couture, designers and detail.”</p><p>To better educate yourself, talk to people who run various local&nbsp;high-end&nbsp;vintage&nbsp;stores or seek out local vintage dealers.</p><p><strong>Tailor it</strong><br>If you fall in love with something that doesn’t quite fit, remember that vintage items can always be nipped and tucked to make them perfect for you. “Don’t be afraid to invest a little bit of money to have it properly tailored to your body. If you invest $25 [or] $30 in having the cuffs shortened or the waist slightly taken in so that it’s not puffy, it can make the difference of looking frumpy to looking like it’s tailor-made,” says Raymond.</p><p>That said, there are items from another era that simply cannot be altered, so it pays to be aware of your body’s proportions. No matter how much you adore the fabric of a coat or the drape of a dress, if they’re too short or long-waisted it may not read right, Raymond points out.</p><p><strong>Feel the fabric</strong><br>You may fall in love with a beautiful printed&nbsp;garment&nbsp;or a beaded dress, but check to see if the fabric is in good condition. “I always like to really look at and touch the clothing, to make sure it still has life in it. Vintage pieces often get brittle and dry and shatter. There’s nothing more heartbreaking than investing some money in something and having it fall apart on you.” If a garment looks like it’s cracking, pulling, falling apart, or fading, it’s probably wise to leave it.</p><p><strong>Say no to plastic</strong><br>We’re all guilty of letting our clothes hang around in those pesky dry cleaning bags, but Raymond says it can be&nbsp;especially&nbsp;harmful to vintage&nbsp;pieces. “Never store your things in plastic—ever! Because plastic, if you think about it, doesn’t allow a garment to breathe. So if any moisture exists in the air, or let’s say you take a shower and your closet is next to your bathroom, the moisture accumulates and can cause deterioration or even mildew.”&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Image via Getty&nbsp;</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ynrdKhoKimXam2sb%2BOam5vamdpfKm71marqGWSqsZuwsinq5qflWKwrbvToaCnn18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
