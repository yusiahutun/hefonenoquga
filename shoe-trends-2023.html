A great pair of shoes should do the trick. Sure, a sporty pair of shoes may help your speed, but a fabulous pair of shoes will help your confidence—it’s easy to walk strong and tall when you love what’s on your feet. Whether it’s a pair of heels or sneakers, the <a href=# rel=noopener>shoe trends for 2023</a> include a style for every occasion (and weather forecast) to ensure you’ll love getting wherever it is you’re going. You may be fashionable, but you certainly won’t be late!&nbsp;</span></p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/kate-middleton-hospital.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/prince-harry-uk-charles.jpg><p><span>Unlike clothing trends, shoe silhouettes themselves stay more consistent over the years (and a good pair of shoes will last you far longer than that). But individual shoe styles and trends will shine within each category. Take <a href=# rel=noopener>the sneaker category</a> for example. Up until around 2016, it was considered weird to wear sneakers with a more formal outfit like a dress or suit set. Then, everything changed when the massive Balenciaga Triple S sneaker was released in 2017. Suddenly, dad shoes were cool again. Around the same time, brands like Nike that have both a streetwear and sports focus had some hits—like the revival of the Nike Air Force 1 (that’s still going strong). And finally, brands that were once considered to exclusively be sportswear broke onto the fashion scene. Suddenly style icons were wearing Asics running shoes and New Balance sneakers to fashion week.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The breakout sneaker star of 2023 is without a doubt the <a href=# rel=noopener>Adidas Samba sneaker</a>: a shoe originally created for indoor soccer, made mainstream by the likes of Bella Hadid. The original shoe retails for under $80 and sold out quickly after going viral on TikTok as Hadid’s shoe of choice. Likewise, the $850 version of the shoe sold out just as quickly when it was included in a pink hue as part of the Adidas x Gucci collab. The sleek, low-top style of the Samba sneaker is the basis of the trend and is sure to be replicated by brands throughout 2023.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Another shoe category (and arguably the best one) is boots. <a href=# rel=noopener>Knee-high or high heel</a>, pointed-toe or square, there are so many boot trends, I can’t possibly mention them all here—though I did mention<a href=# rel=noopener> my 12 favorite pairs</a> in another story. For 2023, you can expect boots to get elevated, literally. Say goodbye to the lug sole trend and hello to boots with skinny heels.</span></p><p class=p1><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

While the style was once only affiliated with ultra-preppy fashion and school uniforms, it’s now considered an It Girl staple. Similar to the trending penny loafers and ballet flats, Mary Janes maintains a sophisticated everyday style while still being comfortable. They can be worn to the office with slacks or a long dress just as easily as they can be paired with a mini dress and easily can be worn over a pair of socks. Designers like Miu Miu and Chanel are leading the preppy footwear trend with Mary Janes and ballet flats as the focus of their 2023 collections. Check out brands like Pedro and Jeffrey Campbell for more accessible styles.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-07-27-at-2.52.41-PM.png alt width=620 height=470 sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Maggie Mary Janes</h2><p>This pair of shoes puts two iconic styles together to make this Mary Jane-ballerina <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">flat hybrid</a>; and let me tell you, we’re loving it. The tweed texture adds just the right amount of warmth and texture for fall dressing. Plus, when you enter the code NEWPEDRO10 at checkout, you can shave 10 percent off of your purchase for both men’s and women’s styles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-07-27-at-2.52.41-PM.png><h2>Regal Mary Jane Pump</h2><p>For a twist on a traditional Mary Jane style, go for <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">this pair</a> covered in crystals. Wear them as a comfortable special occasion shoe or with jeans to jazz up an everyday outfit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shoe-trends-2023-jeffrey-campbell.png><h2>Skinny-Heeled Boots</h2><p>Platform boots have been stomping out the competition for years now but a new boot trend finally found a way to slip in: the skinny-heeled boot. In 2023, sleek, heeled, black leather boots will be the most popular shoe on everyone’s feet. The key to this trend is wearability—the heel height itself shouldn’t be very high at all! Instead, look for a boot with a kitten heel height. This style looks amazing with long dresses and skirts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Untitled-design-16.png><h2>Remy Knee Boot</h2><p>For a heeled boot that’s easy to walk in, look for one with a kitten heel height. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">This knee-high boot</a> from Reformation comes in four color and pattern options and will last you for years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shoe-trends-2023-reformation-.png><h2>Cowboy Leather Boots</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">This pair</a> of suede boots are so fun with a cowboy twist. Wear these with a long dress, mini skirt or even pull out your skinny jeans and tuck those babies in!</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screen-Shot-2023-03-07-at-10.14.46-PM.png></p><h2>Ballet Flats</h2><p>If you like the Mary Jane trend, there’s a good chance you’ve already pulled out your old ballet flats. Ballet flats spun onto the fashion scene this fall (if you believe they ever went out of style) and quickly took over Instagram as a part of the #balletcore aesthetic. The trend is a very literal take on real ballet slippers with brands like Miu Miu and Sandy Liang creating slippers that look as if they could be worn for&nbsp;The Nutcracker&nbsp;ballet. If you like the look of ballet flats but aren’t sure how to style them, it’s important to remember that they don’t need to be styled so literally. Ballet flats look great with baggy cargo pants or jeans and a bomber jacket too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1.png><h2>Runway Ballet Flats</h2><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>The Miu Miu ballet flats</a> have some serious competition with<a href=# rel=nofollow> these Tory Burch runway ballet flats</a>. Next time you’re scrolling through your Instagram explore page, I bet you’ll spot a pair of these.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shoe-trends-2023-tory-burch.png><h2>Bow-Embellished Satin Ballet Flats</h2><p>The sweet light pink shade of<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> these ballet flats</a> is reminiscent of childhood ballet classes and will give all of your outfits some nostalgic girly flair.</p><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$162.50 (originally $250)</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shoe-trends-2023-porte-and-paire.png><h2>Soccer Sneakers</h2><p>In order to score some major style points, you’ll need a pair of soccer sneakers in your closet—Adidas Sambas to be exact. You don’t need to have any intention of wearing these shoes for sport, they’re perfect for daily non-athletic use. If you need style inspiration, you can see some of <a href=# rel=noopener>Bella Hadid’s best Samba looks here</a>. For styling, lean into the soccer look by pairing the sneakers with taller socks. This shoe comes in multiple colorways so don’t be afraid to branch out beyond traditional sneaker shades of white and black.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/7.png><h2>Samba Classic Shoes</h2><p>These are <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">the classic Samba-style shoes</a> and dare I say they are a lot more interesting than a plain pair of white sneakers. This pair is also available in black.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shoe-trends-2023-adidas-2.png><h2>Adidas Velosamba Shoes</h2><p>If you prefer a pop of color, opt for one of the colorful gum bottoms of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">this pair</a> of Adidas Velosamba shoes. You can’t go wrong, whether you pick this pink pair or the cobalt blue also available on the Adidas site.</p><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$98 (originally $130)</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screen-Shot-2023-03-07-at-10.25.26-PM.png><h2>Metallic Footprints</h2><p>Metallics have been having a major moment in formal wear and now you can have shoes to match your sparkly dress! Metallic boots, heels and ballet flats are declaring themselves the new neutral—and I’m totally on board! Even though silver is a total statement, it goes with every color. Whether you’re wearing a floral dress, black trench coat or sporty puffer, a metallic accent will upgrade the look. The trend is particularly taking off with styles of knee-high boots, a perfect option for when you need a break from formal heels.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2.png><h2>Shiren Boots</h2><p>Get the best of both worlds by combining the cowboy boot trend with the metallic trend. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">This pair</a> of Dolce Vita boots would be Hannah Montana-approved.</p><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$149.90 (was $295)</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shoe-trends-2023-dolce-vita.png><h2>Pointed Toe Pumps</h2><p>Not only are <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">these silver pumps</a> trendy, but they’re also super comfortable. You’ll be glad these are on your feet when you’re heading into the office or dancing the night away at a party.</p><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$308 (originally $385)</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screen-Shot-2023-03-07-at-10.34.35-PM.png><h2>Track Shoes</h2><p>She’s a runner, she’s a fashion star. The ultra-sporty, safe-to-really-go-for-a-run-in sneakers are still going to be a top trend in 2023 (comfort lovers rejoice!). Sport-focused fashion continues to be a tentpole for designers and I predict that as long as sporty sunglasses are in style, legitimate track sneakers will be too. For a fully functional and fashionable pair, check out athletic brands like Asics and Salomon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/6.png><h2>Gel-1130 Sneakers</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">This pair</a> of Asics sneakers will take you from the track to your iced coffee run. I’ve had my Asics for years and they’re still the go-to shoe in my closet.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-07-27-at-3.07.04-PM.png alt width=650 height=334 sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Salomon XT-6 low-top sneakers</h2><p>Originally designed for hiking and trail running, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Salomon sneakers</a> are understandably an acquired fashion taste. If you love the Gorpcore look (like I do), this pair of Salomon sneakers is a must for your starter pack.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-12-28-at-10.52.57-AM.png><h2>Designer Rainboots</h2><p>Speaking of functional, rainboots are now becoming an all-weather footwear option, especially if they’re from a designer brand. Logo-embossed rainboots from Chanel have been flying off shelves and Bottega Venetta’s puddle boots are still selling strong. These styles look especially great when paired with taller socks underneath. The only question is if you spend hundreds of dollars on rainboots, do you really want to get them wet? For a more affordable option, brands like Hunter have styles that will last you decades.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-07-27-at-3.13.57-PM.png alt width=538 height=378 sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><span class=product-heading__name__product>Rubber Logo Pull-On Rain Booties</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">These Burberry rainboots</a> are way too cute to save for a rainy day which is why you should wear them no matter the weather. They come in this classic Burberry print.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-07-27-at-3.07.04-PM.png><h2 class="P682H t1yis sxEtG jRV6p">Original Play Rain Bootie</h2><p>For a shoe that’s both functional and fashionable, you can’t go wrong with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">a pair of Hunter rain boots</a>. Style these with non-rain gear, like an unexpected sequin skirt, to get the full fashionable effect.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/banner-newsletter_july2020.jpg alt="StyleCaster newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ynrdKhoKimXam%2FprrDrGZqa2NnhHp%2FjqyfqJ1dqb%2BmusOsZGtoYmh8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
