The overall message of the song is about rising above negativity and becoming the best version of oneself, even in the face of criticism and doubt.

It speaks to the theme of embracing individuality and pursuing one's dreams relentlessly, regardless of any external judgments or setbacks.Another important lyric is "You was talkin' shit, now I'm somebody you would love to be." Here, Miller addresses the idea of proving others wrong and turning their doubts into envy. This theme highlights the power of self-belief and the ability to use criticism as motivation to achieve greatness.
