Not to forget the controversies that surround that song. But never before did we actually stop to think about the secrets or hidden meanings behind those famous songs. Music is undoubtedly an art, more precisely an abstract art. And unless (and until) you understand the inspiration behind a song deciphering its true hidden meaning can be quite difficult and challenging.</p><p>Songs really can be tricky, now that you think of it. So, today we will reveal the secrets of the 15 famous&nbsp;songs that have hidden meanings that even the most loyal fans won't know!</p><p>Ready for engaging truths?</p><h2><strong>15 popular songs with hidden meanings: Secrets Revealed</strong></h2><h3><strong>1. Watermelon Sugar by Harry Styles - 2019</strong></h3><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>The song Watermelon Sugar by <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","15 most popular songs with hidden meanings: Secrets Revealed","1191832","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/harry-styles-20-fun-facts-about-this-superstar-singer-actor-1190384","articlepage","/entertainment/popular-songs-with-hidden-meanings-1191832","Harry Styles","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","NA")'>Harry Styles</a> is actually incredibly sexual in its nature (how did we miss it, I mean, look at the lyrics AND the music video - all the signs are there!)</p><p>"I want your belly</p><p>And that summer feelin'</p><p>Getting washed away in you</p><p>Breathe me in</p><p>Breathe me out</p><p>I don't know if I could ever go without"</p><p>And this fact was confirmed by Harry Styles himself!</p><p>While performing in Nashville, Harry told the audience that this song is basically about the female orgasm that adds to the overall sweetness of everyday life. Now that you know the hidden meaning behind this song, listen to it again. How does it make you feel?</p><h3><strong>2. Chandelier by Sia - 2014</strong></h3><p>The song Chandelier by Sia is actually an anti-pop anthem that talks about her struggles with alcoholism and addiction. Before you toss it away, read these lyrics below. I'm sure, you'll connect them to the secret fact that we just revealed.</p><p>"Can't feel anything, when will I learn?</p><p>I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist</p><p>Like it doesn't exist</p><p>I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night</p><p>Feel my tears as they dry</p><p>But I'm holding on for dear life</p><p>'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight</p><p>On for tonight</p><p>Sun is up, I'm a mess"</p><p>Additionally, Sia, the Grammy award-winning singer, herself stated that she wrote Chandelier as a song that would rebel against the never-ending urge to keep the party going on and revelry.</p><h3><strong>3. 1985 by Bowling For Soup - 2004</strong></h3><p>The song 1985 by Bowling For Soup is actually a cover of the original version by SR-71, a fellow pop-punk aficionado!</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Now, when you listen to both versions, you will notice that this cover song, 1985 by Bowling For Soup, the <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","15 most popular songs with hidden meanings: Secrets Revealed","1191832","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/from-j-hope-to-nayeon-top-5-k-pop-solo-artists-to-give-mega-hit-songs-in-2022-1189517","articlepage","/entertainment/popular-songs-with-hidden-meanings-1191832","pop","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","NA")'>pop</a>-punk band, is not quite as zestful. Also, the tempo feels a little bit off. We are sure any music enthusiast will almost immediately notice these differences. However, if you did not know these two hidden secrets, both the song versions are pretty similar to each other.</p><h3><strong>4. The Way by Fastball - 1998</strong></h3><p>There is a lot going on in the&nbsp;chart-topping&nbsp;song The Way by Fastball than you may have guessed. The inspiration behind this soundtrack is the real-life tragic story of an elderly couple from Texas - Raymond and Lela Howard, who were <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","15 most popular songs with hidden meanings: Secrets Revealed","1191832","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/luke-bell-1185907","articlepage","/entertainment/popular-songs-with-hidden-meanings-1191832","suffering gravely from mental illness","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","NA")'>suffering gravely from mental illness</a>.</p><p>Don't believe us? Read these lyrics -</p><p>"They made up their minds</p><p>And they started packing</p><p>They left before the sun came up that day</p><p>An exit to eternal summer slacking</p><p>But where were they going without ever knowing the way?</p><p>You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere</p><p>They won't make it home</p><p>Their children woke up</p><p>And they couldn't find 'em</p><p>They left before the sun came up that day</p><p>They just drove off and left it all behind 'em"</p><p>The story goes that one day, both of them went for a drive and got lost. They were found later, lying in a ditch, dead. And these lines pretty much sum up the tragic story of that elderly couple. A rather deep hidden meaning, right?</p><h3><strong>5. Slide by The Goo Goo Dolls - 1998</strong></h3><p>The song Slide by The Goo Goo Dolls is, in fact, not the love song that people assume it to be. On the contrary, this song describes how a young couple weighs their options after an unplanned pregnancy.</p><p>&nbsp;Not sure? Check out these lyrics -</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>"Don't you love the life you killed?</p><p>The priest is on the phone</p><p>Your father hit the wall</p><p>Your ma disowned you</p><p>Do you wanna get married Or run away?</p><p>And I'll do anythin' you ever dreamed to be complete</p><p>Oh, we'll run away, run away, run away"</p><p>These lines pretty much sum up the secret that we revealed. Plus, now you cannot simply ignore the <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","15 most popular songs with hidden meanings: Secrets Revealed","1191832","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/10-lesser-known-facts-about-ridi-the-indian-european-pop-star-1189773","articlepage","/entertainment/popular-songs-with-hidden-meanings-1191832","fact","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","NA")'>fact</a> that the second verse of this song (beginning with the lines "Don't you love the life you killed?") is actually suggesting of referring that the couple either got an abortion or are thinking about it.</p><h3><strong>6. Semi-Charmed Life by Third Eye Blind - 1997</strong></h3><p>The song Semi-Charmed Life by Third Eye Blind is probably the furthest thing you will hear from a radio-friendly <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","15 most popular songs with hidden meanings: Secrets Revealed","1191832","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/top-10-k-pop-songs-that-will-make-you-feel-beautiful-1191139","articlepage","/entertainment/popular-songs-with-hidden-meanings-1191832","pop tune","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","NA")'>pop tune</a>. Yes, you heard that right!</p><p>Before you doubt us, read these lyrics and decide for yourselves -</p><p>"I want something else to get me through this</p><p>I want something else, I'm not listening when you say good-bye</p><p>I was taking sips of it through my nose</p><p>Doing crystal meth, will lift you up until you break</p><p>Those little red panties they pass the test</p><p>Slide up around the belly, face down on the mattress one"</p><p>Well, I am quite sure that these lyrics indicate the true hidden meaning behind the song. Titles can really be deceptive at times, don't you think?</p><h3><strong>7. Waterfalls by TLC - 1994</strong></h3><p>The song Waterfalls by TLC is yet another song that is mistaken for a <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","15 most popular songs with hidden meanings: Secrets Revealed","1191832","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/top-5-john-legend-songs-that-will-give-you-the-best-rb-vibes-1189777","articlepage","/entertainment/popular-songs-with-hidden-meanings-1191832","love song","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","NA")'>love song</a> but, in reality, is the furthest thing from it. It actually makes a radical social commentary about murder, drug abuse, and HIV. In simple words, this song highlights all the things that predominantly affect young black women and men alike.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h3><strong>8. No Rain by Blind Melon - 1992</strong></h3><p>The song No Rain by Blind Melon actually throws light on the struggles with depression of Brad Smith, the <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","15 most popular songs with hidden meanings: Secrets Revealed","1191832","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/american-indie-rock-band-mgmt-1183668","articlepage","/entertainment/popular-songs-with-hidden-meanings-1191832","band","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","NA")'>band</a>'s bassist.</p><p>Wait, read these lyrics -</p><p>"I just want someone to say to me,</p><p>"I'll always be there when you wake."</p><p>And I don't understand why I sleep all day</p><p>And I start to complain</p><p>That there's no rain</p><p>And all I can do is read a book to stay awake</p><p>And it rips my life away,</p><p>But it's a great escape"</p><p>Now, you get our point. Shannon Hoon, the lead singer, ditched the band's most popular tune to write about his teammate's depression. The song lyrics mention the early days of Brad in LA when he was struggling with depression and could not even get motivation or reason enough to get out of his bed in the morning.</p><h3><strong>9. Under The Bridge by The Red Hot Chili Peppers - 1991</strong></h3><p>The song Under The Bridge by The Red Hot Chili Peppers is basically an ode to Anthony Keidis, the singer's drug-using days. Yes, that's right!</p><p>This song is referencing a bridge in Los Angeles, under which the singer Anthony Keidis used to consume drugs or shoot up.</p><p>If you are having a hard time believing us, look at this line in the song&nbsp;"Under the bridge downtown, is where I drew some blood..."</p><p>What do you think it signifies?</p><h3><strong>10. Summer Of 69 by Bryan Adam - 1984</strong></h3><p>The song Summer Of 69 by Bryan Adam is probably one of the <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","15 most popular songs with hidden meanings: Secrets Revealed","1191832","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/nicki-minaj-1184503","articlepage","/entertainment/popular-songs-with-hidden-meanings-1191832","most famous songs","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","NA")'>most famous songs</a> that everyone has heard multiple times and danced and grooved to it. However, the secret here is that this song is not really an ode to Americana. In reality, this song is about the first summer wherein the singer Bryan Adams performed a sexual act of 69. Yes!</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Do you still not believe us? Read these lyrics -</p><p>"Spent my evenings down at the drive-in</p><p>And that's when I met you, yeah</p><p>Standin' on your mama's porch</p><p>You told me that you'd wait forever</p><p>Oh, and when you held my hand</p><p>I knew that it was now or never</p><p>Those were the best days of my life</p><p>Me and my baby in '69"</p><p>We know, you or practically anyone may think that this soundtrack is an ode to '60s lore just because Bryan Adams bought his real first six-string at the Five and Dime. But sorry to burst your bubble, it is not true!</p><h3><strong>11. Pink Houses by John Cougar Mellencamp - 1983</strong></h3><p>The song Pink Houses by John Cougar Mellencamp is, as a matter of fact, an anti-American protest song. Unbelievable, right?</p><p>These lyrics are actually sarcastic -</p><p>"Oh, but ain't that America</p><p>For you and me</p><p>Ain't that America</p><p>Something to see, baby</p><p>Ain't that America</p><p>Home of the free, yeah"</p><p>Plus, numerous politicians have tried to use this song in their campaigns. However, the singer John Cougar Mellencamp maintained that this song was written about how the American dream has become dystopian and perverted over time.</p><p><strong>12. Only The Good Die Young by Billy Joel - 1977</strong></p><p>Do not mistakenly think that the song Only The Good Die Young by Billy Joel has some kind of profound philosophical meaning behind it because of its title. In reality, this song is provocatively sexual in its nature (gasp)</p><p>See the lyrics here -</p><p>"Come out, Virginia, don't let me wait</p><p>You Catholic girls start much too late</p><p>You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>You got a brand new soul</p><p>Come out, come out, come out</p><p>Virginia, don't let me wait"</p><p>These lines are nothing but proof that a young boy is trying to convince a Catholic girl to lose her virginity. Every line of this song has a hidden meaning making it highly deceptive and contrasting to its title.</p><h3><strong>13. A Boy Named Sue by Johnny Cash - 1969</strong></h3><p>The song A Boy Named Sue by Johnny Cash is not literally by Johnny Cash. What do we mean?</p><p>We mean that the lyrics of this song were written by Shel Silverstein, who was a children's author and an equally iconic poet. Undoubtedly, Johnny Cash's unmistakable baritone voice made this into a classic and <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","15 most popular songs with hidden meanings: Secrets Revealed","1191832","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/muse-s-singer-matt-bellamy-1183604","articlepage","/entertainment/popular-songs-with-hidden-meanings-1191832","famous rock","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","NA")'>famous rock</a> song, but the truth is the truth. Isn't it?</p><h3><strong>14. Mr. Tambourine Man by Bob Dylan - 1965</strong></h3><p>The song Mr. Tambourine Man by Bob Dylan is actually dedicated to a drug dealer! Yes, you heard us.</p><p>Now you must be thinking about why to hide this secret. Right? The reason is actually pretty simple. During the period this song was written and released, songs talking about illicit drug use would have most likely fallen victim to censorship. In order to avoid this, the artists had to get creative. However, if you concentrate on the lyrics of Bob Dylan's song Mr. Tambourine Man, you will instantly realize that it leaves very little room for interpretation. See for yourself -</p><p>"Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me</p><p>I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to</p><p>Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship</p><p>My senses have been stripped</p><p>My hands can't feel to grip</p><p>My toes too numb to step</p><p>Wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin'</p><p>I'm ready to go anywhere</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>I'm ready for to fade</p><p>Into my own parade</p><p>Cast your dancing spell my way</p><p>I promise to go under it"</p><p>Do you get our point now?</p><h3><strong>15. Tutti Frutti by Little Richard - 1955</strong></h3><p>The hidden meaning behind the famous song Tutti Frutti by Little Richard is way too far for you to discover it. This song is actually an ode to the love of anal sex that Little Richard had. Will you ever be able to listen to this song the same way? I guess not, never!</p><p>The lyrics "She rock to the east She rock to the west" are enough to make you understand what Little Richard is trying to convey. Now imagine this is that upbeat song that we have all sung along to and danced to at parties and weddings - how bizarre!</p><p>We feel you - even we wish we knew this atrocious hidden meaning before (sigh)</p><p>How many of these secrets did you know? Did you discover any other secret about a famous song or artist?</p><p>Tell us in the comments section below!</p><p>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","15 most popular songs with hidden meanings: Secrets Revealed","1191832","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/pink-floyd-10-most-weird-songs-by-the-rock-band-1190542","articlepage","/entertainment/popular-songs-with-hidden-meanings-1191832","Pink Floyd: 10 Most weird songs by the rock band","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","NA")'>Pink Floyd: 10 Most weird songs by the rock band</a></p><p>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","15 most popular songs with hidden meanings: Secrets Revealed","1191832","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/10-most-infamous-moments-of-the-emmy-awards-to-date-1189987","articlepage","/entertainment/popular-songs-with-hidden-meanings-1191832","Primetime Emmy Awards: 10 Most infamous moments of the Emmys to date","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","NA")'>Primetime Emmy Awards: 10 Most infamous moments of the Emmys to date</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6W8scHLmqlmq5%2BjtLR51qKroWWYnrGlsc1mpJ6Znp67qL%2BMamhyaWhofw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
