Choupette is now worth millions of dollars and has plenty of modeling jobs and businesses behind her, and there were even rumors that she had inherited Lagerfeld's fortune when he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>died in 2019</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lagerfeld, who preferred to keep his personal life private, was always willing to talk about Choupette and his love for her. "I like being calm, and my cat is a presence that counts but isn't encumbering," he once said in an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Numéro magazine</a>. "She is peaceful, funny, fun, and gracious, she's pretty to look at and has good poise, but her main quality is that she doesn't talk."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The iconic fashion designer even said that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>being Choupette's owner</a> helped him "become a nicer person."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Because there is something very touching about her, you see," he told PEOPLE in 2019. "Even if she is spoiled beyond."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Lagerfeld died in February 2019</a> from pancreatic cancer at age 85, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Choupette released a statement</a> about his death on Instagram. Alongside a photo of the cat wearing a black veil, a caption read: "With a once cold but now simply broken heart, I am going into mourning. I pray that your kind words and well-wishes will help me to put my best paw forward in my future without Daddy @KarlLagerfled & as my own woman."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the years since his death, Choupette has been busy honoring Lagerfeld's memory. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Per the New York Post</a>, she was even invited to attend the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>2023 Met Gala</a>, the theme of which is dedicated to the late designer's legacy. While the feline <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>opted to stay "cozy at home"</a> rather than walk the red carpet, several celebrities, including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Jared Leto</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>paid tribute to Choupette</a> at the iconic event.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lagerfeld and Choupette clearly had a very strong bond. In a 2017 interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>CNBC</a>, Lagerfeld said that he never thought he "could fall in love with animal like this," adding that Choupette "gives energy" and leaves him feeling "recharged."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for everything there is to know about Karl Lagerfeld's cat, Choupette.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-was-adopted-by-lagerfeld-in-2011></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She was adopted by Lagerfeld in 2011</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Choupette Lagerfeld Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Choupette first entered Lagerfeld's life in 2011, when he adopted her from a model.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2016, Lagerfeld told Numéro magazine that French model Baptiste Giabiconi went on vacation and left Choupette with the staff at Lagerfeld's home. "She was still a baby at the time, and I found her so cute that when Baptiste came home I said to him, 'Sorry but I'm keeping her!' " he said. From then on, Lagerfeld and Choupette were inseparable.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-her-name-has-a-special-meaning></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Her name has a special meaning</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Choupette Lagerfeld Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The name Choupette means "sweetie" in French. But aside from that, it's a pet name in Lagerfeld's life that he used even before naming his cat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There are people I call my Choupettes.

Now, Choupette really is famous. She has become the most famous cat in the world."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He went on to say that he would get "propositioned" by pet food companies, which is "out of the question," because Choupette is not "commercial."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-used-to-dine-with-lagerfeld></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She used to dine with Lagerfeld</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Choupette Lagerfeld Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the later years of his life, it appears that Lagerfeld and Choupette did nearly everything together. In his interview with Numéro, Lagerfeld revealed that they would regularly eat meals together — and Choupette was a pretty picky eater.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She sits opposite me and eats what she has to eat," he explained. "Before she might have attacked any old prawn, but now she will only touch the four different dishes prepared for her on that day, served in fabulous bowls. Everything must be very fresh, otherwise Mademoiselle sits in front of her biscuits for three quarters of an hour giving me filthy looks, without eating a thing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lagerfeld also said that Choupette doesn't like to eat on the floor, so he would put "the food on the table." She eats out of dishes by Goyard and has had special meals prepared for her by renowned chefs. Some of these include "Japanese-style beef" and "chicken gelée with asparagus."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-is-very-pampered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She is very pampered</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Choupette Lagerfeld Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The fashion designer was always very vocal about how much he spoiled Choupette, and even after his death the pampered feline still gets the royal treatment. Choupette has at least <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>two maids, a personal driver and a social media manager</a>. Her maids also used to keep a personal diary for Choupette, writing down everything they did for her throughout the day for Lagerfeld to read through later. She also gets regular manicures and has her own iPad.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a 2015 interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Cut</a>, Lagerfeld said of Choupette: "She hates animals and she hates children." He added that her maids would play with her, but also "have to take care of her beautiful white hair, the beauty treatments for her eyes, and they entertain her."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He went on to call her "the center of the world," adding, "There is something unforgettable about her, the way she moves, the way she plays. She's an inspiration for elegance. For attitude."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shes-extremely-clean></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She's extremely clean</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Choupette Lagerfeld Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As far as pets go, cats are known for being fairly clean, and that is especially true for Choupette. In his 2016 interview with Numero, Lagerfeld said that even when Choupette was a kitten, she "never soiled the floor." He went on to say that she "spends her life washing herself" and "smells very good."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She has a nice natural odor," he said. "Which isn't the case with everyone."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shes-a-successful-model></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She's a successful model</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Choupette Lagerfeld Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the years, Choupette has developed a modeling career of her own. She has booked a handful of gigs, including several high-paying ones that earned her millions of Euros, as Lagerfeld told The Cut.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of those was her own capsule cosmetics collection with the Japanese beauty brand Shu Uemura. The collection was called Shupette, and it launched in 2014 as part of a collaboration with Lagerfeld. That same year, Choupette also had her first book published, Choupette: The Private Life of a High-Flying Fashion Cat. It featured tons of her modeling photos as well as advice on lifestyle, diet, fashion and beauty.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2015, Lagerfeld and Choupette starred in a collection of his eponymous clothing collection together, which was sold on StyleBop.com. French artist Tiffany Cooper sketched out images of Lagerfeld and his cat on a pretend "summer road trip," and put those images on items like shirts and accessories.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following Lagerfeld's death in 2019, Choupette's social media director announced the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>launch of a new collection</a> with the cat: a commemorative RIP Daddy collection.
