“We’re friends. We’re happy. Everybody’s happy,” the 74-year-old recently told People, adding that they’re “very close.”
The pair married in 1982 after meeting in 1971 when the 70-year-old actress saw Danny perform in the stage production of The Shrinking Bride. They went on to have three kids together — Lucy, 36, Grace, 34, and Jake, 31."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The duo have appeared together in films like the beloved 1996 movie Matilda and TV shows like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taxi</a>, which ran from 1978 to 1983.</p><p>Danny and Rhea first announced their split in October 2012. They reconciled in March 2013 but then broke it off again four years later. It’s pretty clear it has been quite the roller coaster ride. That said, it is nice to hear that, even though they’ve had their ups and downs, they are at least very amicable.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheers</a> alum can next be seen in the film Poms with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Diane Keaton</strong></a>, while Danny can be seen in the Disney’s live-action remake of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dumbo</a>, in which he plays ringmaster Max Medici. The It’s Always Sunny in&nbsp;<i>Philadelphia</i> costar told the outlet how excited he was that the movie’s director,&nbsp;<strong>Tim Burton</strong>, asked him to be in the film.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Danny-DeVito.jpg><p>“I felt really honored to be in his movie,” he said. “I wouldn’t have been able to live with myself if I wasn’t in this film. This is one of my favorite Disney movies. [The new movie] captures all the feelings and sensibilities of [the original] — how people push away something different. And then also the idea of figuring out how to conquer the fears and insecurities that we have in life.”</p><p>Danny added: “It’s all there with Tim’s incredible artistry.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46dmKemqWKxpsLIraZmq5GuwG60xGaYp5xdp7WmrYypnKuknZa7bq3RnmScpJ%2Bosm6wxKynoqyVYsCxuMitZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
