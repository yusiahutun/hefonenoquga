Closer Weekly exclusively chatted with experts who weighed in on the actress’ recent appearance. <a href=#>Dr. Andrew Miller</a> states, “It looks like she may have had either Botox to the forehead or a brow lift due to the elevation of the eyebrows.”</p><p>And <a href=#>Dr. Adam Hamawy</a> agrees. “We’ve seen a few changes on how Renée Zellweger looks. A few years ago we can see that she had too much Botox giving her forehead that frozen look. Since then she looks like she’s using less Botox and allowing for a softer more natural look while maintaining its anti-aging benefits,” he told Closer. “The rest of the changes I see I think mostly can be attributable to weight fluctuations. I really don’t think she was getting fillers or fat injections like many people were thinking. I believe she had simply gained weight and we see her now after she lost it again.”</p><p><a href=#>Dr. Vartan Mardirossian</a> also opened up about the actress’ face and admitted she may have gotten filler to the cheeks and lips and a rhinoplasty, among other things. “[She likely gotten] Botox to the forehead because no lines or hint of lines on the forehead are noticed,” he said, adding, “She has a very smooth jawline but cannot comment if it is natural or a lift was performed.”</p><p>The blonde beauty also addressed reports that she had work done on her eyes in an essay for <a href=#>The Huffington Post</a>. “Not that it’s anyone’s business, but I did not make a decision to alter my face and have surgery on my eyes,” she wrote. “It’s no secret a woman’s worth has historically been measured by her appearance… The resulting message is problematic for younger generations and impressionable minds, and undoubtedly triggers myriad subsequent issues regarding conformity, prejudice, equality, self-acceptance, bullying, and health.”</p><p>Renée has received support from plenty of fans since speaking out, including pal Reese Witherspoon, who condemned the treatment her friend has gone through about her appearance. “It’s horrible,” the 41-year-old said about comments made by bullies on social media. “It’s cruel and rude and disrespectful, and I can go on and on and on. It bothers me immensely.”</p><p>Speaking at a <a href=#>Hollywood Reporter</a> roundtable, the mother-of-three added, “I know this is so Pollyanna of me, but why — and it’s particularly women — why do they have to tear women down? And why do we have to tear other women down to build another woman up? It drives me crazy. Like, this one looks great without her makeup but that one doesn’t look good without her makeup, and it’s all just a judgment and assault.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46rnKedlWLHprjLsJygnaJiva2t0q2gnGWjqr%2BosdGyZGpsZGx9cXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
