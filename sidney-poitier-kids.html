He was the youngest of seven children. His parents, Evelyn Outten and Reginald James Poitier, were farmers in the Bahamas and owned a farm on Cat Island, which they would often travel from to Miami to sell tomatoes and other produce. Poitier was born unexpectedly in Miami two months premature while his parents were visiting. He remained in Miami for three months before he became healthy enough to come back with his parents to the Bahamas, where he was raised.</p><p>When Poitier was 15 years old, he was sent to Miami to live his brother. At 16 years old, he moved to New York City, where he worked as a waiter before he enlisted in the army. After the army, Poitier auditioned for a role with the American Negro Theater, which he won. After the production, Poitier was cast as the lead in Broadway’s Lysistrata before his breakout role as Gregory W. Miller in the 1955 movie Blackboard Jungle. After Blackboard Jungle, Poitier went on to star in movies like&nbsp;Porgy and Bess, A Raisin in the Sun, To Sir, with Love, Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner and In the Heat of the Night.&nbsp;In 1964, he became the first Black man to win the Oscar for Best Actor for his role in the 1963 movies, Lilies of the Field. Throughout his career, Poitier received two more Oscar nominations, 10 Golden Globe nominations, two Emmy nominations, six BAFTA nominations and one Screen Actors Guild nomination. He was the oldest surviving male Academy Award winner until his death in 2022.</p><p>So who are <a href=# rel=noopener>Sidney Poitier’s kids</a> and where are his children now? Read on for what we know about Sidney Poitier’s daughters and how many of them followed in their father’s footsteps.</p><h2>Beverly Poitier</h2><p>Beverly Poitier is Sidney Poitier and Juanita Hardy’s first daughter and his eldest child of his six kids. Beverly is an artist and jewelry designer who has her own <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Etsy page</a>, Poitier Henderson Jewelry, and collection with the jewelry brand <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Kazuri West</a>. “A video producer and writer by trade, growing up Beverly loved to collect rocks,” her artist page on Kazuri West reads. “However, it wasn’t until she attended a jewelry show of a local Atlanta artist, that she thought about turning her affinity for stones into jewelry. Beverly began with books on jewelry design, then classes and workshops. She discovered endless ways to hone her craft. Today, her bold and striking designs are one of a kind, mainly because creating the same thing twice seems to be an impossible task for her. There’s always a variation on the theme. Her mediums of choice are the famed Kazuri beads, precious metals, gemstones and polymer clay. Kazuri gives her an added sense of satisfaction, because of the seemingly endless variations, and the story behind the beads. She calls the Kazuri beads the beads that keep giving. All who touch them are passing on a blessing.”</p><p>Beverly named her jewelry brand, Poitier Henderson Jewelry, after her father and her husband, her high school sweetheart, with whom she lives in the suburbs of north Atlanta, Georgia. “Beverly lives in the suburbs of Atlanta with her husband who is her high school sweetheart,” her artist page continues. “She named her company, Poitier-Henderson Jewelry after her two favorite guys, her father and her husband. You may have heard of her dad, legendary actor, Sidney Poitier. He loves her jewelry, but unfortunately she can’t get him to wear any of it! At least not yet, perhaps one day she’ll design a men’s line!”</p><p>Along with her career as an artist, Beverly has also worked in the casting department of the 1991 movie Separate But Equal, which starred her father. In 2002, she wrote and published her own fiction book, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Nana</a>, about a grandmother who can talk to ghosts and her 30-year-old single granddaughter (named Pamela after Beverly’s younger sister), whom she want to match make. “Self-publishing the book was extremely empowering. Why would I wait for a publishing house to tell me my work is good and put a stamp of approval on it or am I going to have enough confidence to put it out here myself?” Beverly said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Vidette Online</a> in August 2001.</p><p>She continued, “Nana is my first novel and I really enjoyed writing it. It was extremely fast because the characters just seemed to take over. The idea came from a lot of places – from a little old lady I knew at church, members of my family and things like that.”</p><h2>Pamela Poitier</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pamela-Poitier.jpg><p>Birthday: April 12, 1954</p><p>Pamela Poitier is Sidney Poitier and Juanita Hardy’s second daughter and his second eldest child of his six kids.

She also acted as an understudy on Broadway. Later in life, Pamela moved to her father’s home country of the Bahamas, where she filmed the documentary, Islands of Life, which raised awareness for the preservation of the Bahamas’ ecological diversity. She lives on the Cat Island in the central Bahamas.</p><p>“I live off the grid,” she told students at R.B. Hunt Elementary School in St. Augustine when presenting the film. “I get my electrical power from the sun, I catch rainwater on my roof and I use composting toilets.” She continued, “My mother was half Cherokee, and she raised me with a credo. That is that we don’t own any part of this planet, that we’re just passing through. And we’re obligated to leave it better than it was when we go. We’re going to depend upon all of you to help us clean up the Earth.”</p><p>Pamela also teaches acting classes in the Bahamas. “I decided to teach these classes to share my knowledge of Strasberg’s acting method that I learned from Lee Strasberg himself and then was asked by him to teach in his school in New York City,” Beverly told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Tribune</a> in 2013. “I believe that there are many more talented people in the Bahamas like my father.”</p><h2>Sherri Poitier</h2><p>Birthday: July 12, 1956</p><p>Sherri Poitier is Sidney Poitier and Juanita Hardy’s third daughter and his third eldest child of his six kids.

In high school, she met “the love of her life and soul mate, Gaetan Gouraige.” The two married in 1988 and went on to welcome four children. Her youngest child, Emmanuel, passed before she died.</p><p>After she graduated from high school, Gina went on to attend Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey before she transferred to the State University of New York in Albany to be “closer to the aforementioned love of her life,” according to her obituary.

It continued, “As the youngest child Gina, was loved tremendously, spoiled by her mother and her second Mother ‘Mama Jean’. Gina spent many a day on her father’s lap escaping the strict discipline her expected from her sisters.”</p><h2>Anika Poitier</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Anika-Poitier.jpg><p>Birthday: February 29, 1972</p><p>Anika Poitier is Sidney Poitier and Joanna Shimkus’ eldest daughter and the second youngest child of his six kids.

The New York Times best seller looks back on the Oscar winner’s life and career, from his childhood on the tiny Cat Island of the Bahamas to his roles in movies like A Raisin in the Sun and Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner?&nbsp;“In the kind of place where I grew up,” Poitie writes in The Measure of a Man. “What’s coming at you is the sound of the sea and the smell of the wind and momma’s voice and the voice of your dad and the craziness of your brothers and sisters…and that’s it.” The book—which explores the measures that make Poitier a man, husband, father and an actor—also sees the award-winning actor reflect on the racial barrier he overcame to become one of the most successful stars in the Golden Age of Hollywood. “I have no wish to play the pontificating fool, pretending that I’ve suddenly come up with the answers to all life’s questions,” Poitier writes in <a data-pmc-sp-product=2ee0aab75023360a8a06378be3af22f5 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"The Measure of a Man","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"The Measure of a Man: A Spiritual Autobiography (Oprah&#39;s Book Club)","price":"8.97","id":"0061357901","category":"Actors & Entertainers"},"id":1246736,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>The Measure of a Man</a> . “Quite that contrary, I began this book as an exploration, an exercise in self-questing. In other words, I wanted to find out, as I looked back at a long and complicated life, with many twists and turns, how well I’ve done at measuring up to the values I myself have set.”</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
