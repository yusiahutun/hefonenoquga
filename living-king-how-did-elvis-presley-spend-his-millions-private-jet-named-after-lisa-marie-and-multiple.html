In another Bel Air property, Presley famously met <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">The Beatles.</span></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/31/64a66d14-0951-4dbb-8b2a-0c8161189576_2f737907.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After marrying Priscilla in 1967, Presley bought a lavish Beverly Hills estate for his new family to live in. Costing US$400,000 at the time, it had five bedrooms, three bathrooms and a swimming pool, and legendary crooners Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin were the couple’s neighbours. The property was later bought by Hard Rock Cafe owner Peter Morton. Presley also reportedly owned properties in Holmby Hills, Mississippi and Palm Springs.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">A private jet fit for a king</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/31/dd0f0c1d-7215-4873-9bd7-631db92815f3_34c07427.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Presley’s most famous private jet is probably the one he bought in 1975 and named after his daughter Lisa Marie, the 1958 Convair 880, per Graceland’s website. It had a private bedroom, conference room and lavish details like 24 carat gold-flecked sinks and gold-plated seat belts. Renovations to the aircraft reportedly cost US$800,000 alone, per Aerotime.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the rock star actually owned multiple planes that made up an impressive fleet. In 1975, he splurged US$900,000 on another plane, the Hound Dog II, which was a Lockheed Jetstar executive business jet, per Aerotime. Presley’s third aircraft was a smaller Lockheed Jet Star that had pink velvet seats, per Graceland’s website.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Who’s the richest Presley?

He lovingly gifted his so-called Elvis Rose Cadillac to his mother, as he promised her years before.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/31/8952585b-6083-456f-b845-9a7b2a865407_d40e4bb7.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">GQ reported that he also cruised around town in a BMW 507, Lincoln Continental Mark 5, Ford Thunderbird, Rolls-Royce Phantom 5, Mercedes-Benz 600 and Ferrari Dino 308 GT4.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Presley also had a fleeting appreciation for life at sea. In 1964, the Suspicious Minds musician shelled out US$55,000 for a gigantic yacht called the Potomac, which had previously been owned by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and was known as the “floating White House”, per Outsider. Soon after he bought the vessel though, Presley donated it to St Jude’s Children Hospital so that the charity could sell it and raise money.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Watches, jewellery … and jumpsuits</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/31/25ad2af0-a0f5-474e-a62b-b6049d9c2e14_1ad35eea.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The King’s glamorous stage outfits didn’t come cheap.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Presley was known for his diamante jumpsuits and, according to Outsider, his most expensive one was the “Aloha” outfit. Costing US$65,000 at the time – US$250,000 in today’s money – it was the one he wore for his first show broadcast by satellite, Aloha from Hawaii, in 1973. Rolling Stone reported that he almost fell over backwards when he first tried it on because the cape weighed more than 5kg. Most of his other jumpsuits cost around US$2,000 each, also per Outsider.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, watches The King owned included a gold Rolex King Midas, multiple Hamilton Ventura models and two Omega Constellations, per Chrono24. In 2018, his Tiffany-Dial Omega sold for a record US$1.8 million, becoming one of the most expensive Omega watches ever sold, reported Hodinkee.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although it’s unclear exactly how much Presley spent in total on jewellery, we know the first 14 carat gold and diamond TCB ring he had made set him back US$40,000 when he bought it – equivalent to nearly US$200,000 today. It sold in a 2020 auction for US$400,000, according to National Jeweler.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">3 weird diets from old Hollywood, including Elvis’ Sleeping Beauty trick</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">A hefty divorce settlement with Priscilla</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/31/00568e9a-8dfe-4f6f-ad97-a9bb11f51f0e_de730b37.jpg>When <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Priscilla and Elvis divorced in 1975</span></a>, the musician was originally ordered to pay his ex-wife US$100,000, but after she appointed new lawyers who fought for more cash on her behalf, Elvis ended up handing over US$750,000 (US$5 million in today’s money), according to British media.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This was in addition to a Mercedes-Benz, a 1969 Cadillac El Dorado and a 1971 Harley-Davidson motorbike, as well as five per cent of the royalties from Elvis’ publishing companies.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Expensive gifts and allowances for friends and family</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/10/31/6636121f-41a3-4574-b9d4-8ecdaad060c5_94934cd1.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A lot of Presley’s money went to friends and family.

He’d also give out cars as though they were candy.
