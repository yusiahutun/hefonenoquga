This was up six per cent on the average amount couples spent in 2021, which was £17,300, and a whopping increase of 102 per cent from 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic and its restrictions meant that <a class=hm-link href=#>micro-weddings costing an average of £9,100 became the norm</a>.</p><h2>Key wedding costs</h2><p id=eFJrmz8L7hHa data-wc=34>There are some elements of a wedding that can prove the biggest expenses of your big day, such as your wedding venue – at an average cost of £8,400 according to the aforementioned study.&nbsp;</p><p id=eNa0_zpOqSDP data-wc=10><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>How much should you spend on a wedding ring?</a></strong></p><p id=euB2pb_hve1Y data-wc=20>Other key costs include the bride's wedding dress (£1,350), photography (£1,300), videography (£1,150) and catering (on average £70 per head).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f759fd8fcefe-istock-1212579783.jpg><h2>How much does a wedding cost abroad?</h2><p id=e26KRy4GWStb data-wc=55>The cost of a wedding abroad can be dependent on the destination chosen, and how many guests you are inviting. According to research from <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>American Express</a>, Spain and Ireland are the top destinations to tie the knot outside of the UK this year, with 12 per cent of wedding guests heading to each location respectively.</p><p id=ejA7o6X9gk data-wc=9><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>How to avoid hidden costs of destination weddings</a></strong></p><p id=eSTOg2e3NPbA data-wc=41>In Spain, the average cost of a wedding in Spain stood at 20,000 euros in 2022 – equating to around £17,200. The figures, shared by <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Statista</a>, say that this included all expenses, such as wedding outfits, the venue, music and catering.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/33857e5280b2-istock-1388570773.jpg><p id=ekpzWdqvnbdF data-wc=47>In Ireland, the average wedding costs 25,000 euros (around £21,500), according to a survey by <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Wedding & Honeymoon Show.</a> However, for 31 per cent of couples this cost can increase to as much as 35,000 euros (£30,000), making Ireland a particularly expensive destination for a wedding.</p><h2>How much does a wedding cost for 50 guests?</h2><p id=e3WAVd2KbP_b data-wc=82>The average couple invited 81 guests to their wedding in 2022 according to Hitched, so having a smaller guest list of around 50 guests is likely to help you make significant savings on your big day. When you consider that meals alone can cost around £70 per head, that alone could save you as much as £2,000. Meanwhile, a smaller guest list may also allow you to book a more intimate venue, which could also offer some savings compared to bigger venues.</p><p id=eRgkpnp1hTUW data-wc=10><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>How many people should I invite to my wedding?</a></strong></p><h3>How much does a wedding cost for 200 guests?</h3><p id=eaXYDTXI0m5Q data-wc=41>Naturally, a bigger guest list means a bigger budget. With 200 guests you can expect your wedding to cost anywhere between £24,000 and £34,000, depending on the style of wedding you're hosting and the time of year you're planning to marry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/24a999c643a6-istock-544489935.jpg><p id=eLibIdJ6UDmf data-wc=41>A lavish wedding with a sit-down meal and extravagant décor will likely place your wedding at the upper end of the price limit, while a more relaxed, rustic wedding with DIY elements could help to make a bigger wedding more budget-friendly.</p><h2>What is a good budget for a wedding?</h2><p id=eegtmZjyQnyZ data-wc=80>Based on the current average wedding costs, a budget of around £18,000 would be sufficient to cover your expenses. However, your personal budget will vary depending on what you have planned for your nuptials and when and where you're going to tie the knot. Some things, such as photography or videography, may be non-negotiable, whereas you may be able to reduce costs on other elements, for example, if you're happy to buy a <a class=hm-link href=#>high street wedding dress</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>bridesmaid dresses</a>.</p><p id=eUeipxjwUC data-wc=11><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>9 sneaky wedding venue costs that can derail your budget</a></strong></p><h2>Who traditionally pays for the wedding?</h2><p id=eOJZvyX3nz88 data-wc=44>Tradition previously stated that <a class=hm-link href=#>the bride's family should pay for the wedding</a>, but this has changed over time, with more couples covering the cost of their nuptials, while 63 per cent receive money from family or friends to help pay for the big day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4320b5b1f3bf-istock-909118338.jpg><h2>How much does it cost to attend a wedding?</h2><p id=eY2ZlCciecRC data-wc=48>It's not only the couple hosting the wedding who have to consider their budget, as recent research from American Express has found that UK wedding guests are expected to spend 18 per cent more on attending weddings in 2023, or an average of £1,045 per wedding this year.</p><p id=e0SjhKxkOvqG data-wc=18>Costs that wedding guests have to cover include buying a wedding gift, accommodation, childcare, travel, outfits and accessories.</p><p id=ewqAQ8NGOgi data-wc=26><strong>Planning your wedding?
