We bounced from <a href=#>Chocolate Hazelnut Linzer Hearts</a> to <a href=#>Chocolate Peanut Butter Cheesecake</a> before landing on a <a href=#>Double Chocolate Banana Bread</a> which, even a month later leads to the weekly “accidental” purchase of way more bananas that we’d ever eat, so we “have” to make more, no violins necessary. Thus, it would be easy to blame the boys in my family for what I did to an innocent coconut macaroon — that is, saddling it with not one but two types of chocolate, until it was intensely fudgy and brownie-like with an almost gooey center, seriously why aren’t you baking these yet? — but guys, this was <b>all me</b>.</p><p><span id=more-11739></span></p><p><a href=# title="grind the coconut"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7364/13780728374_58e11cd4c6_z.jpg alt="grind the coconut" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a href=# title="unsweetened chocolate wins"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm3.staticflickr.com/2940/13780388673_d8a503a4fc_z.jpg alt="unsweetened chocolate wins" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Because although I do not share my family’s perspective that if it’s not chocolate, it’s not worth eating, I feel adamant that if you’re going to eat chocolate, it should really, really taste like chocolate. And, pitifully, every chocolate coconut macaroon I’ve had, along with <a href=#>some other cookies</a> that will no doubt cause you to storm out of here in disgust once and for all, failed this test.</p><p><a href=# title="dark chocolate coconut macaroon batter"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7397/13780733264_655891fb07_z.jpg alt="dark chocolate coconut macaroon batter" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><a href=# title="scoop them tiny; they're intense"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3772/13780392785_df8cf0494d_z.jpg alt="scoop them tiny; they're intense" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a href=# title="cookies might look underbaked"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7213/13780395323_7566be5470_z.jpg alt="cookies might look underbaked" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>A few tablespoons of cocoa powdered added to a standard coconut is just not enough. It makes coarse, muddy-brown marbles with weak flavor. It’s for compromising, not aspiring, and I think we should all dream big in the kitchen, about macaroons and everything else. And so, I made a few changes. I know it’s less popular these days, but I really prefer sweetened coconut flakes for macaroons, as it packs in a tremendous amount of moisture; dry macaroons shouldn’t be a given. As I’ve done before, I began by grinding down my shredded coconut for a smoother and more nut-like texture. I used cocoa powder, but more than is usually recommended, and I underbaked them, just a little, for that tender-centered effect. But it was the melted chocolate that was the revelation. Semisweet chocolate was good, but deeply bitter unsweetened chocolate catapulted this cooking into a level of chocolate intensity that could only be likened to a truffle, or a brownie. A deep, dark, fudgy brownie. That’s butter-free, flour free and takes all of 10 minutes to assemble. Dark chocolate macaroons for lunch today, anyone?</p><p><a href=# title="dark chocolate macaroons"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7020/13780739884_683b7f8388_z.jpg alt="dark chocolate macaroons" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><a href=# title="really dark fudgy chocolate coconut macaroons"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm3.staticflickr.com/2842/13780401425_673cf98360_z.jpg alt="really dark fudgy chocolate coconut macaroons" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><b>Macaroons, previously:</b> <a href=#>Raspberry Coconut Macaroons</a>, <a href=#>Blackberry and Coconut Macaroon Tart</a> and a <a href=#>Chocolate Hazelnut Macaroon Torte</a> we love so much, I made a massive version of it for my father-in-law’s 65th last month, where not a single person was gluten-free.

Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.</p><p>Heat approximately half of chocolate chunks in a small saucepan until just melted, then, off the heat, stir in the remaining chunks until they’re smooth. The residual heat should be enough to melt them and leave the mixture lukewarm; if it’s not, heat the mixture again until just melted, but not very hot.</p><p>In a food processor, blend the coconut for one full minute. Add sugar and cocoa powder, blend another full minute. Add egg whites, salt and vanilla and blend until combined, then the melted chocolate until smooth. With a tablespoon measure or cookie scoop (I used a #70 scoop), scoop batter into 1-inch mounds. You can arrange the cookies fairly close together as they don’t spread, just puff a bit.</p><p>Bake cookies for 15 minutes, until the macaroons are shiny and just set. Let them rest on the tray for 10 minutes after baking (or you can let them fully cool in place, if you’re not in a rush to use the tray again), as they’ll be hard to move right out of the oven. They’ll firm up as they cool, but still remain softer and less dry inside than traditional macaroons. <i>Thank goodness.</i></p><p>I like to dust them with a little powdered sugar once they’re cool. They’ll keep in an airtight container until your family finds out about them, or one week, whichever happens first.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-11739 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-11739 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
