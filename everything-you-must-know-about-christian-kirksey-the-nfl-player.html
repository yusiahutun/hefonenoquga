His second year was much better as he started all 13 games for his team and recorded 62 tackles with five tackles to defeat, one sack, one interception, three pass breaks, and two forced fumbles. The following year, Kirksey was named team captain, recording 95 tackles with 3.5 tackles to defeat, two QB sacks, two interceptions, four regained fumbles, two misses, and one forced fumble. As a senior he recorded 104 tackles with 5 tackles for loss and 2.5 sacks, two recovered fumbles and two forced fumbles, one interception, and one forced fumble.</p><p>At the end of the season, he earned an honorable All-Big-Ten Mention before accepting an invitation to participate in the 2014 Senior Bowl. Kirksey impressed scouts and team representatives during training and at the game itself, and also visited the NFL Combine where he only performed in the vertical jump, long jump, and bench press.
