After all, this honor crosses genres and decades and places songs from a wide variety of backgrounds in competition with one another. The 1992 hit “Nutin’ but a ‘G’ Thang” by Dr. Dre has the impressive status of number 29 on the list.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_68>The magazine calls the song “a smooth and inimitable kickback classic that would help define [Dr. Dre’s] career following the demise of N.W.A.” It also featured an artist then known as Snoop Doggy Dogg. Collaborating with Dr. Dre on the 1992 album&nbsp;Chronic helped establish Snoop Dogg’s name in the rap business. When he went to release <a href=#>his own debut album</a> the next year, he was poised for success.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_32>That effort, called&nbsp;Doggystyle, climbed the charts in its own right and kicked off a music career that has gone on for three decades, helping Snoop Dogg acquire a $150 million net worth.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-snoop-dogg-was-in-jail-when-the-song-was-recorded>Snoop Dogg was in jail when the song was recorded</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Proud to work with <a href=#>@SnoopDogg</a> who shares our belief that there is a better way to feed our future.

As an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">All Music</a> review of the song explains, “Coupled with his inventive rhymes, Snoop’s distinctive style made him a superstar before he’d even released a recording of his own.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_86>The song’s content featured signature themes that would define both rappers’ careers: “lyrics that celebrated life on the streets and the amoral toughness it took to survive there.”&nbsp;“Nuthin’ but a ‘G’ Thang” was also musically complex with samples from “I Want’a Do Something Freaky to You” by Leon Haywood and Public Enemy’s “B Side Wins Again.” The end result was a catchy tune that helped demonstrate Dr. Dre’s staying power in a post-N.W.A. world while serving as an in-your-face introduction of Snoop Doggy Dogg’s signature flair.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_64>Those who went beyond the single and <a href=#>dove into the whole&nbsp;Chronic album</a> were treated to much more of Snoop Dogg’s lyrical talents. The rapper features heavily across multiple tracks on the album. We can assume that once the jail-recorded demo was out for “Nuthin but a ‘G’ Thang,” the rappers were able to make more hospitable arrangements for recording the rest of the tracks.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAr7vOqWSdp5ecerOxwqipnZ2UYru2wMeipWaapal6onnGZquhmZ6ceqWxzKhkn6qfonqrrcilZaGsnaF8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
