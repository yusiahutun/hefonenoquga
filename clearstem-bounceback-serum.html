Speaking from personal experience, my acne-prone skin flared up at different points in college, and it has continued to stick around as I’ve entered my mid-twenties. I know plenty of other people who also have adult acne.

Founders Danielle Gronich and Kayleigh Christina discovered a gap in the market for anti-acne and anti-aging products that <a href=# id=auto-tag_exclude data-tag=exclude>exclude</a> hormone disruptors, toxins and pore-clogging ingredients. The brand has so many amazing formulas, like the </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>CELLRENEW Collagen Stem Cell <a href=# id=auto-tag_serum data-tag=serum>Serum</a></span></a><span> and </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>CLEARITY Mandelic Acid Serum</span></a><span>, but today, I’m shining the spotlight on the </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>BOUNCEBACK Serum</span></a><span>—also referred to as the “No Botox Serum.”</span></p><p><span>The formula promises to renew, restore and rejuvenate your complexion with the help of three key ingredients. CLEARSTEM’s proprietary blend of </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>stem cells</span></a><span> promotes collagen production, which is essential to increasing skin elasticity and reducing wrinkles. Green tea and peptides are also vital inclusions since they activate the stem cells to start working their magic.</span></p><p><span>Additionally, </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>peptides</span></a><span> firm sagging skin and </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>argan oil</span></a><span> prevents free radical damage and plumps areas of concern.
