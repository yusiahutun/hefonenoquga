While a few of these reality stars got put in cuffs before they made their Bravo debut, others have faced the police while the cameras rolled. Thankfully, they all seemed to have learned their lesson and have no plans to let it happen again.</p><p>While we await Jen Shah's sentencing on "Real Housewives of Salt Lake City" after pleading guilty to fraud earlier this year, here's what some other "Real Housewives" had to say about their arrests.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:9ce16b4a-f142-4314-a94f-df713c8dd044 data-container-ref=toofab:article:de29e80c-f897-40f6-a560-efb23e93a142 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/29/5by4/2022/09/21/299455d0cc5244678b57a24ba54c9dc3_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kathy Hilton Accused of Threatening to 'Destroy Kyle and Her Family' In RHOBH 'Meltdown'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>1. </strong><a href=#><strong>Luann de Lesseps</strong></a></p><p>Luann de Lesseps was going through a difficult time when she was arrested in 2017. The reality star was put in cuffs after reportedly refusing to leave a hotel room and shoving a police officer who responded to the call in Palm Beach, Florida. She was charged with disorderly intoxication, battery on an officer/firefighter/EMT, resisting arrest with violence and threatening a public servant, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office.</p><p>"This was my first time in Palm Beach since my wedding, and being here brought up long-buried emotions. I want to offer my sincere apologies to anyone I might have offended with my behavior," she <a href=#><u>said</u></a> in a statement at the time.</p><p>Luann later agreed to a plea deal that helped her avoid jail time but subject her to one year of probation, 50 hours of community service, two AA meetings per week, and a Mothers Against Drunk Driving class. Two years later, Luann violated her probation and was <a href=#><u>reportedly</u></a> ordered to undergo weekly counseling sessions, monthly psychiatric sessions, to take medication for her alcoholism, and keep a breathalyzer monitoring device in her car.</p><p><strong>2. </strong><a href=#><strong>Leah McSweeney</strong></a></p><p>Back in 2002 -- before her time on the show -- New York City housewife Leah McSweeney was arrested during an altercation outside Hammerstein Ballroom. It happened while she and a date were exiting the venue around 4 AM along with the rest of the crowd. The couple ended up stopping to share a kiss and in the middle of everything, police stepped in to clear the crowd and pulled them apart. Suddenly, officers began beating her date and she did the only thing she could think of at the moment to help him.</p><p>"It was really scary. And I had a half-empty plastic water bottle with me and I threw it -- not even directly at someone, just threw it in that direction. It was just a total knee-jerk reaction. But it hit a cop in the back. He turned around and lunged at me and punched me in the face. I fell onto the sidewalk, and suddenly I had four cops on my back, cuffing me. I just felt so many knees on my back. And one of them slammed my face into the subway grates and knocked my tooth out," Leah told <a href=#><u>People</u></a>.</p><p>She ended up pursuing legal action and wound up with a $75,000 payout that she used to kick-start her clothing company, Married to the Mob.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:60a5706a-ce02-4f23-acc8-8d141f887659 data-container-ref=toofab:article:de29e80c-f897-40f6-a560-efb23e93a142 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/71/5by4/2022/08/30/7184c1bbc7bf41c0aaae9e2b194eb806_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">These Celebs Admit They Had A Falling Out With Their Former BFFs</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>3. </strong><a href=#><strong>NeNe Leakes</strong></a></p><p>As a young woman, "Real Housewives of Atlanta" star NeNe Leakes was arrested on quite a few occasions. She revealed in her autobiography, "Never Make the Same Mistake Twice," that she was once arrested for shoplifting from a mall with a friend. Then in 1992, she was <a href=#><u>reportedly</u></a> arrested and charged with one misdemeanor and three felony counts of "theft of services" from her phone company. She pleaded guilty to all four counts and was sentenced to two years of probation and ordered to repay $2,650. She went on to be arrested three more times for probation violations.</p><p><strong>4. </strong><a href=#><strong>Kim Richards</strong></a></p><p>Amid Kim Richards' struggle with substance abuse, she was arrested for public intoxication, trespassing, resisting an officer and battery while at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2015. Just a few months later, she was arrested once again when she was accused of stealing hundreds of dollars of items from Target. She was later <a href=#><u>placed</u></a> on a three-year probation and ordered to attend AA meetings as well as complete 450 hours of community service.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:09059f99-44b3-4ad0-b401-ac3f206c75d7 data-container-ref=toofab:article:de29e80c-f897-40f6-a560-efb23e93a142 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/9f/5by4/2022/09/15/9f436ceaf2bd48e289be669a297415d6_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo/Variety</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Erika Jayne Reacts to Jennifer Lawrence Calling Her 'Evil'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>5. </strong><a href=#><strong>Tinsley Mortimer</strong></a></p><p>In 2016, Tinsley Mortimer was arrested and charged with trespassing the home of her ex-boyfriend Nico Fanjul in Palm Beach, Florida.

She pleaded not guilty ... but it's unclear what happened after that and she's never spoken about the incident.</p><p><strong>7. </strong><a href=#><strong>Danielle Staub</strong></a></p><p>"Real Housewives of New Jersey" star Danielle Staub and an old boyfriend were once arrested for their involvement in holding a man for ransom following his involvement in a botched cocaine deal. At the time of her arrest, Danielle was in possession of six kilos of cocaine and $16,000 in cash. She pled guilty to one count of extortion and agreed to cooperate with the FBI for a more lenient punishment but still ended up spending nearly a month in jail. Looking back, Danielle <a href=#><u>says</u></a> her participation in the crime was minimal, only going as far as to place the ransom money phone call.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:ea67b282-608f-4c74-a35b-ad8e703e2381 data-container-ref=toofab:article:de29e80c-f897-40f6-a560-efb23e93a142 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/52/5by4/2022/08/26/520237f565054b998042c4507d5702ef_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Stars Deny Orchestrating Social Media Attack on Garcelle's Son</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>8. </strong><a href=#><strong>Brandi Glanville</strong></a></p><p>In 2010, Brandi Glanville was pulled over while driving in Beverly Hills and was arrested for drunk driving.
