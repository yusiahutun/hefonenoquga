Brittany Mahomes, wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, shared new photos from a girls' night featuring none other than Taylor Swift.
The singer, 33, was pictured in snaps shared by the 28-year-old on her Instagram, taken from what appears to be Taylor's own Tribeca apartment, as they enjoyed a night of wine and football.
Taylor reportedly hosted a football viewing party for the Chiefs' recent match in Germany, which featured the singer's new love interest Travis Kelce, and also invited Lyndsay Bell and Paige Buechele, the wives of tight end Blake Bell and former quarterback Shane Buechele."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>
