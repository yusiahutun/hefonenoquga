During a recent episode of <a href=#>The Talk</a>, <a href=#><strong>Sharon Osbourne</strong></a> revealed a very sexy thing her husband, <a href=#><strong>Ozzy Osbourne</strong></a>, used to do for her when they would have private time away from the kids.</p><p>“My husband used to dress up for me,” she said to her cohosts — <a href=#><strong>Eve</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Sheryl Underwood</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Carrie Ann Inaba</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Marie Osmond</strong></a>. This, of course, caused them all to swoon and as for more details.</p><p>“Who was he dressing as?” Sheryl, 56, asked excitingly.</p><p>“He would dress up in evening wear and he would be like a waiter and he would have the beautiful black tie with no trousers holding a tray and he’d say, ‘Can I help you, madam?’ And I’m like, ‘Yes!‘” Sharon, 67, replied.</p><p>After the couple split in 2016 due to Ozzy’s multiple affairs, they got back together and are now doing <a href=#>“1,000 percent better”</a> than they were before. “It’s a journey, really, a marriage. You go up, you go down, you make mistakes … I’ve learned a lot this year,” Sharon said on The Talk in November 2017. &nbsp;“Yes, [we are&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">back together</a>.] It’s been very hard … He’s very embarrassed and ashamed about his conduct.”</p><p>“I forgive, [but] it’s going to take a long time to trust. But you know, we’ve been together for 36 years, 34 of marriage, and it’s more than half of my life and I just can’t think of my life without him,” she added. “Even though he is a dog! A dirty dog! So there you go … He’s going to pay for it though, big time.”</p><p>In a previous interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, Ozzy, 70, opened up about his relationship with Sharon and said, for him, the secret to a happy marriage is to keep your lady happy. That and, you know, not to cheat on her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_editorial_9710043s.jpg><p>“Don’t get caught with your mistress.” He said. “It’s a rock ‘n’ roll thing — you rock and you roll. You take the good with the bad. When I was a crazy f–ker, I’m lucky she didn’t walk out. Now I’m coming on five years clean and sober, and I’ve realized what a f–king idiot I was. I mean, I’m still nuts, but in control of it a bit more … When I said, ‘Don’t get caught by your mistress,’ I’m not proud of all that sh-t.”</p><p>We’re so happy that Sharon and Ozzy are back in a good place!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46sn5qqn6N6sL%2FBqKyrppVitba%2FwZqlnWWfr8e6edSsnJ1lpKR6pb7ErKpmraBitq9506GcZpqVmb%2Bwu8xo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
