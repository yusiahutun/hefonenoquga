I Have a Dream</strong><strong>?</strong></h2><p>The host for Mamma Mia! I Have a Dream is British radio and television presenter Zoe Ball. The former BBC Radio 1 host spoke to ITV1 about the competition series, explaining the premise and format of the show.&nbsp;</p><p>“We have taken seven boys and seven girls, they made it to the last 14 out of thousands who auditioned, and they are then put through their paces by the MAMMA MIA! gods, Judy Craymer, Anthony Van Laast, the choreographer, Martin Lowe, he’s the musical expert, and a panel of experts,” she said. “They do singing and dancing and acting workshops and basically we are seeing who will become the next Sophie and Sky. It’s whittled down, week-on-week, and each show opens with a fabulous song and dance routine set in the streets or the beaches of Greece. It looks very much like MAMMA MIA! the movie.”&nbsp;</p><p>“The setting is perfect,” she continued. “For our Sophies and Skys, they’re already in the beating heart of the place where this story is set. The girls can get themselves in the head space of Sophie, who’s been brought up on an island in Greece. She’s not been brought up in a usual manner. She’s a real hippie kid. She’s quite free spirited. She’s just been brought up by her mum.”&nbsp;</p><p>Ball went on to add, “And there’s Sky. When I think of Sky, I always think of all the boys I’ve fallen in love with on holiday who might have been some kind of ski instructor, water sports instructors, who are just hot and dynamic.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-are-the-judges-on-mamma-mia-i-have-a-dream><strong>Who are the judges on Mamma Mia! I Have a Dream?</strong></h2><p>The judging panel for Mamma Mia! I Have A Dream includes comedian Alan Carr, West End star Samantha Barks, Olivier Award winner Amber Riley, and singer Jessie Ware. With their unique perspectives and insights, these judges will provide the contestants with feedback on what it takes to shine on London’s prestigious West End stage.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mamma_mia_i_have_a_dream_sr1_03_0.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-are-the-mamma-mia-i-have-a-dream-contestants><strong>Who are the </strong><strong>Mamma Mia! I Have a Dream</strong><strong> contestants?</strong></h2><p>The cast of Mamma Mia! I Have A Dream includes 14 musical theater performers. See below for the full list of contestants.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Desmonda – 27, from Indonesia</li><li>Esme – 22, from Chester, England</li><li>Leah – 20, from Redcar, England</li><li>Maddy – 20, from Bolton, England</li><li>Maisie – 22, from Margate, England</li><li>Stephanie – 22, from St. Albans, England</li><li>Stevie – 22, from Glasgow, Scotland</li><li>Callum – 22, from Oxfordshire, England</li><li>Craig – 26, from Perthshire, Scotland</li><li>Darcy – 23, from Hampshire, England</li><li>Marcellus – 36, from High Wycombe, England</li><li>Owen – 25, from Belfast, Northern Ireland</li><li>Tobias – 22, from Somerset, England</li><li>Zachkiel – 21, from London, England</li></ul><p>In an interview with ITV1, original Mamma Mia! creator and producer Judy Craymer explained why she felt now was the right time to bring this talent search to the small screen. “MAMMA MIA! the musical stage show is celebrating its 25th Anniversary on 6th April 2024, so it felt like the perfect time to commemorate this unique moment with a TV show to find musical theater stars of the future,” she shared. “We really have something to celebrate.”</p><p>“The story of MAMMA MIA! is cross generational – about a mother and daughter. I thought the idea of a TV show to fill the young roles would make entertaining TV whilst finding new talent for musical theater,” Craymer continued. “MAMMA MIA! has always encouraged young actors and given opportunities to those making their stage debuts. So complete with a stunning backdrop of an idyllic Greek location – where the original MAMMA MIA! is set – I sensed this was the most perfect TV format that will search out the next generation of musical theater talent and hopefully inspire the generation after that.”</p><p>She went on to add that Mamma Mia! I Have a Dream “will be a TV show bursting with all the sparkle and energy of the MAMMA MIA! stage show and movies, and an incredible opportunity to shine a light on the West End and theater in general.”</p><p>Alan Carr, a judge on the series, gushed about the opportunity to work alongside Craymer on this project. “She’s such a legend in the industry, it just gives it an authenticity. And for our performers — who are all fantastic actors, singers and dancers —even if they don’t ultimately win that role in MAMMA MIA!, they are spending time with this team of showbiz legends, they have been able to showcase their talents in-front of them,” he told ITV1.&nbsp;</p><p>“I feel like this show is one massive audition, not just for the roles of Sophie and Sky. Judy would chat to us about what she saw, who she’d like to see as Sky and Sophie,” Carr explained. “It is really interesting because she lives and breathes MAMMA MIA!, the movies and everything. This woman who’s watching you perform, she chats to Cher, Meryl Streep, Julie Walters. She has a lot of power and it’s OK you’re performing to us four judges sitting there.”</p><p>For fans of the franchise, Craymer hopes that fans will admire the care that went into developing the series. “This TV show is filmed on a sun-kissed Greek Island, so the audience will immediately enter the magical world of MAMMA MIA! and be transported to this idyllic location with a backdrop of a beautiful villa where the TV creative team have painstakingly constructed the set with every amazing detail of the stage show and movies,” she shared. “The fans, I think, will appreciate the detail. Audiences can expect total escapism — this show looks and feels like no other entertainment show on television. It is high-energy, feel-good, all-singing, all-dancing.”</p><p>Mamma Mia!
