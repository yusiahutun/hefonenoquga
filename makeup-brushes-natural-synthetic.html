When it comes to powder products, natural makeup brushes are your best bet. They work wonders with any powder from bronzers to eyeshadows, and everything in between, as they are loaded with texture so you’ll get a better application. Natural hair bristles move freely, allowing you to not only pick up enough product in one swipe, but also to blend it out beautifully.</p><p><a title="How to (Really) Clean Your Makeup Brushes" href=#>MORE: How to Really Clean Your Makeup Brushes</a></p><p><strong>Our favorite natural brushes:</strong>&nbsp;If a brush is going to be natural, we prefer it be cruelty-free and high quality.

Unlike natural brushes, synthetic makeup brushes don’t have a cuticle, which makes them great to use with liquid or cream products, such as foundation and concealer, because they won’t trap makeup. Synthetic bristles tend to gravitate towards one another, making them perfect for precision application.</p><p><a title="8 Must-Try Drugstore Makeup Brushes" href=#>MORE: 8 Must-Try Drugstore Makeup Brushes</a></p><p><strong>Our favorite synthetic brushes:</strong>&nbsp;From getting the perfect cat eye to applying your lipstick flawlessly, precision application calls for synthetic brushes.
