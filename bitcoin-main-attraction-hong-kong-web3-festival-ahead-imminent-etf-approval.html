Mao Shixing, co-founder and CEO of crypto custody and wallet provider Cobo, who uses the name Discus Fish in English, said on Tuesday that he thinks even the prediction of a 2,000 per cent increase in the next six years is “conservative”.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong’s Web3 Festival attracts smaller crowd but greater enthusiasm</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While the conference touched on a range of topics, including real-world asset tokenisation and artificial intelligence, “bitcoin and its ecosystem projects” clearly took “centre stage” at the event, said Lily Z. King, chief operating officer of Cobo.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The excitement also partially stems from active development of so-called layer-2 bitcoin projects, which are networks that run alongside the main blockchain to help it scale through faster transactions. Many crypto firms see this as an opportunity to boost demand for businesses built around bitcoin.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Spot ETFs are driving the most excitement, though, as it will give investors an easy way to expose themselves to bitcoin without needing to worry about managing cryptocurrency keys and storage.</p>Multiple people attending the event said they expect the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to approve spot bitcoin ETFs this month, following the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">approval of such funds in the US</span></a> in January. Tencent News reported that the first batch could be announced as soon as April 15, with mainland Chinese fund managers Harvest International and China Asset Management Company (ChinaAMC) to be among the issuers.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The SFC recently approved Harvest and ChinaAMC to manage portfolios that invest more than 10 per cent in virtual assets, according to the regulator’s website.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong regulators said in December that the city is prepared to allow retail access to ETFs that invest directly into cryptocurrencies and will start to authorise funds that offer such products.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/10/4ffe16fd-77fa-49d0-9c6c-a012f1030165_cc058a73.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Apart from traditional investors, Hong Kong’s bitcoin spot ETFs will be attractive to “crypto native players” because Hong Kong’s regime is currently the only one in the world that allows in-kind subscriptions, said Marco Lim, managing partner at Hong Kong-based crypto hedge fund MaiCapital.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Under such arrangements, participating dealers can directly use bitcoin to subscribe to or redeem spot ETF shares, whereas in the US, these products can only be redeemed with dollars.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs will be a “monumental stride” not only for the local market, but for the global perception of digital assets, said Cobo’s King. It represents a “significant leap” towards recognising cryptocurrencies as legitimate alternative assets and will pave the way for widespread adoption, she added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Excitement is not just limited to bitcoin, though. Some at the Web3 Festival talked of the potential approval of spot ETFs for ether, the native token on the Ethereum blockchain. That is the other cryptocurrency that licensed exchanges can currently offer in Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That would make Hong Kong a first mover in the space, but it could be a harder sell for regulators. Some bitcoin ETF issuers in the US told CNBC this week that they expect the Securities and Exchange Commission to reject ether ETF applications.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwaavx2iZpaeToLCprcinZpqqpJ6wrbGObGlucGVog3CuyK2aqKGeYrqitc1mmK2sopawtbXOp2Shp56ceqy7zaBksJ2SaHqnsdKtoK%2BZnGKuqbHAnWSipZ2eu6a602acrZ5dlr2xvs6vmKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
