Over the years, the designer has breathed extraordinary new energy into the luxury French fashion house. He has collaborated with artists Chapman brothers, punk-era artist Christopher Nemeth, Fragment Design of Japanese icon Hiroshi Fujiwara, and the cult New York-based streetwear label, Supreme.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jones’ last show for Louis Vuitton took place at the Palais Royal. On this rainy day, international guests such as David, Victoria and Brooklyn Beckham, football superstar Neymar, F1 driver Lewis Hamilton, singer Joe Jonas, film director Xavier Nolan and actress Gwendoline Christie were welcomed into the 18th century garden. Fashion designers such as Olivier Rousteing, Humberto Leon, Virgil Abloh, Heron Preston, Stefano Pilati, Craig Green and Chitose Abe sat in the front row.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Entitled “Overview”, the Louis Vuitton autumn/winter 2018 collection was inspired by exploration and travel, featuring multiple landscapes from the Wild West to the Far East.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s about clothes that can change, about fabrics that can travel on the body – and transform. Discover something new. It’s a constant voyage,” Jones says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The key print represented travel, with aerial images taken from a helicopter over the Kenyan landscape. Africa, especially Kenya, has been a recurring theme for the Louis Vuitton shows. since he was born in Africa. Rock-textured prints and snake skins in neutral earth tones such as desert, sandstone, light olive and slate were featured.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Blending themes and cultures, Jones was inspired by American rodeo with flankman-shorts worn over high-performance leggings for pro-athletes. Russia and Siberia were evoked through the shearling and intarsia mink. There were also luxurious fabrics such as cashmere and vicuña with technical details of mountain climbing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The natural colours of the collection were sometimes electrified by energetic neon yellow or fluo orange backpacks or bags. Most models were sporting trekking boots in python skin, Louis Vuitton-embossed monogram and finished with precious titanium.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The show ended with a surprise appearance of supermodels Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell sporting matching vinyl LV-monogrammed trench coats.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Accompanied by the two supermodels, Jones received a standing ovation from the crowd. In years to come, Jones will be remembered as the designer who brought luxury streetwear to Louis Vuitton.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rumour has it that Jones might be headed to Burberry or Versace. On the other hand, it is said that one of the hottest designers, Off-White’s Virgil Abloh, might be replacing Jones.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZp%2BZo522sLqMm5yaraSufKK%2B06KapZ1fZ35zhZZqb2ijmaJ6q7vNnqpmpZGgsrR5xquYp5xdmsWqwIyer5yhpJ67qHnFoqWapJU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
