He lost me,” Ariana said in an interview on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast in May 2023, two months after news broke of Tom and Raquel’s affair. “But I think that I trusted in him so much … that I trusted his perspective on things.” She continued, “I feel like we would have so many amazing times together, so then if there was a couple weeks that were not great or if I was, like, unsure about something [in the relationship], there was so much other stuff that was great. … It was almost, I think, hard to say, ‘Oh, this person’s not right for me,’ because I also had never been in a relationship that long before.”</p><p>When asked if she ever “turned a blind eye” in her relationship with Tom, Ariana admitted that she did. “But I think I was given a lot of assistance in doing that because I would bring things up and I would be shot down,” she said. “I was very much committed and I feel like I was doing my absolute best as a partner. But I don’t think I would do anything differently, just because I feel like all I can do is my best — and whether my best was good enough or not for anyone, that’s what it was.”</p><p>Since then, Ariana has been thriving with her brand deals, collaborations, and even starting up her own company. So what’s <a href=# id=auto-tag_ariana-madix data-tag=ariana-madix>Ariana Madix</a>‘s <a href=# id=auto-tag_net-worth data-tag=net-worth>net worth</a>?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-is-ariana-madix-s-net-worth>What is Ariana Madix’s net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ariana-madix.jpg><p>Ariana Madix’s net worth is reportedly $2 million according to <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/models/ariana-madix-net-worth/>Celebrity Net Worth.</a> Compared to Tom Sandoval, who has a net worth of $4 million.</p><p>Along with&nbsp;Vanderpump Rules, Ariana has a cocktail recipe book with Sandoval titled,&nbsp;Fancy AF Cocktails: Drink Recipes from a Couple of Professional Drinkers. The book was published in 2019. Though Ariana is dating Sandoval, she isn’t one of the OGs, which is why we assume that her salary is likely a little less than the average OG $25,000-per-episode range.</p><p>In 2023, Ariana made it to the finals of the hit dancing competition show Dancing With The Stars. Contestants on the show are estimated to receive a starting salary of $125,000, according to Variety. This salary includes their rehearsal period, which takes place for 20 hours a week for several weeks before the start of the season, along with the first two weeks of their competition on the show. But their earnings don’t have to stop there. Finalists can earn up to a $50,000 bonus if they end up heading towards the finals.</p><p>She’s also slated to open up a sandwich shop with co-star Katie Maloney called Something About Her. It was supposed to open up later in 2023, but was inevitably postponed. “It’s going to be this summer,” Katie recently&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>&nbsp;back in June 2023. “It’s just a matter of if everything goes according to the plan…and there’s no hiccups along the way, which you can’t always plan for.” As for now, Ariana just made her Broadway debut in the long-running show Chicago where she plays Roxie Hart.</p><p>As well as her own endeavors, she’s partnered up with several brands like Lip Lab. “It’s a color for every mood,” the Bravo star <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/beauty/makeup/1624585/ariana-madix-makeup/>told StyleCaster</a> about her collection. “The really dark one [My Ride or Die], that’s for when I’m feeling really fierce. Whenever I’m feeling a little wild, that’s the one.”&nbsp;</p><p>However, despite everything, the reality star stays humble about her earnings.”I think a lot of people on the internet seem to think that I am rolling in money right now. I have a lot of places that that money has to go,” she revealed on an episode of the “Scheananigans” podcast in August 2023. “I am not rich. I do not have millions of dollars.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Single-AF-Cocktails-Ariana-Madix.jpg><p>For more on Vanderpump Rules, check out Ariana Madix’s book, <a data-pmc-sp-product=11930ffb99b19f0d4200aa2d130e8501 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Single AF Cocktails: Drinks for Bad B*tches","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Single AF Cocktails: Drinks for Bad B*tches","price":"18.56","id":"059379687X","category":"Television Performers"},"id":1712792,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Single AF Cocktails: Drinks for Bad B*tches</a> .
