It gave the anime industry’s top studios free reign on telling their own stories with Jedis, droids, and the Empire, which seems like a dream come true for geeks around the world.</p><p>Needless to say, it was a winning combination that could not have been made at a better time, considering some Star Wars fans have moved beyond the divisive Sequel Trilogy, and have embraced the non-Skywalker stories depicted in The Mandalorian and The Bad Batch.</p><p>After watching the nine episodes in this animated anthology series, IGN Southeast Asia has conclusively decided on the ranking of each episode. Granted, none of these episodes are bad by any stretch, but there are those that are better than the rest and open up a lot of potential for more.</p><p>So without further ado, here is a spoiler-free ranking of each episode in Star Wars: Visions.</p><p><strong>9. The Twins by Studio Trigger</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sm.ign.com/ign_ap/screenshot/default/star-wars-anime-main-1280x720_yqtj.jpg><p>As expected from Studio Trigger, the minds behind Gurren Lagaan and Kill la Kill, The Twins is the flashiest and the most ‘anime’ out of the nine episodes. It is filled with an explosion of technicolour and kinetic movements, but it does so by sacrificing substance within its story.</p><p>It recontextualizes the twin sibling dynamic of Luke and Leia by portraying them as being on the side of the Empire and the Dark Side, where we see the two siblings clashing on what they think is best for the galaxy. What ensues is a madcap outer space duel unlike anything we’ve seen in Star Wars.</p><p>Again, in terms of pure spectacle and over-the-top action, The Twins is a marvellous episode, and looks like an extension of Studio Trigger’s work on their film Promare. But besides that, the story is barebones and leaves a lot to be desired.</p><p><strong>8. The Duel by Kamikaze Douga</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sm.ign.com/ign_ap/screenshot/default/screen-shot-2021-08-17-at-91616-am_mdfr.jpg><p>An homage to the Star Wars franchise’s inspiration from early Westerns and Akira Kurosawa films, The Duel has a Force-wielding ronin protecting a small town from raiders. It employs a muted color scheme, mostly black and white with a dash of colour for dramatic effect.</p><p>Like a classic duel in old timey cowboy and samurai films, viewers get to see the central conflict unfold as townsfolk cower in fear. The Duel also makes use of the varied alien species we see across the Star Wars universe, from Ugnaughts to a character that looks like Sebulba from Episode I.</p><p>As an introduction and an appetiser to the rest of the series, The Duel is light on story and heavy on action. Which is not a bad thing, especially if you enjoy the shootouts and lightsaber duels seen in the franchise.</p><p><strong>7. T0-B1 by Science SARU</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sm.ign.com/ign_ap/screenshot/default/star-wars-visions-t0-b1-s-164674799-large_q9tf.jpg><p>A retelling of Astro Boy through the lens of the Star Wars galaxy, T0-B1 (Toby, though we initially thought the name rhymes with Obi Wan) is a young droid created by a humble scientist who regales T0-B1 with tales of the ancient Jedi.</p><p>A droid that thinks it’s a Jedi seems to be the flavour of the month for the Star Wars franchise, though T0-B1 tells its tale with a lot more heart and childhood whimsy. This is exemplified by T0-B1 and his droid buddies searching for a kyber crystal to build their own lightsaber throughout the episode.</p><p>T0-B1 makes full use of the format of Star Wars: Visions, telling a concise story with ups and downs that ends with a major battle. It’ll remind you of Luke Skywalker’s journey in becoming a Jedi, which is always a good thing.</p><p><strong>6. Tatooine Rhapsody by Studio Colorido</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sm.ign.com/ign_ap/screenshot/default/k-344-tatooine-rhapsody-star-wars-visions-386353832_j77b.jpg><p>If you’ve ever wanted to know more about the musicians within the Star Wars universe, beyond the bands in Mos Eisley Cantina and Jabba’s Palace, Tatooine Rhapsody does not disappoint with its story of expression and camaraderie.</p><p>Featuring a ragtag band that features a great mix of aliens from across the galaxy, this episode infuses J-Rock into the Star Wars universe by way of Daft Punk’s Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem anime movie.</p><p>It has a bright and cartoony artstyle, which is par for the course when you have the studio behind the Pokémon: Twilight Wings series doing the animation. A fun rock and rolling adventure that doesn’t overstay its welcome.</p><p><strong>5. The Village Bride by Kinema Citrus</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sm.ign.com/ign_ap/screenshot/default/visions_231s.jpg><p>What’s great about The Village Bride is that it reminds us of those episodes in the Clone Wars where a Jedi would visit some backwater planet, learning the customs of the inhabitants, before getting into action by saving them from some sort of danger.</p><p>This is a familiar premise that we’re happy to see be reinvented for this series, where we see a young Jedi landing on a planet where a marriage is set to take place. What she soon finds out is that this is no ordinary marriage: it is instead one that involves a local warlord with an army of reprogrammed Separatist droids.</p><p>Seeing Jedis in their prime helping out the smaller inhabitants of the galaxy is great to see, especially when there’s some kickass lightsaber action as well.</p><p><strong>4. Akakiri by Science SARU</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sm.ign.com/ign_ap/screenshot/default/akakiri_xprj.jpg><p>One of the tenets of being a Jedi is that one should have no attachments, and this episode explores that side of the faith. It evokes the same tribulations that Anakin Skywalker had to go through in Episode II and III.</p><p>Akakiri sees a young Jedi returning to his home planet to help his childhood friend, a princess, who has been exiled from her home due to the machinations of a treacherous family member. What follows is an arduous journey to the capital of the planet.</p><p>As another nod to Akira Kurosawa, particularly with the film The Hidden Fottress, the Jedi and the princess are aided by two peasant guides who provide some comic relief to the entire affair. Akakiri is a great bookend to Star Wars: Visions and will leave your jaw dropped.</p><p><strong>3. The Elder by Studio Trigger</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sm.ign.com/ign_ap/screenshot/default/star-wars-visions-images-dj1b_dm82.jpg><p>If you were itching to see more of the Jedi Master and Padawan dynamics seen with Qui Gon Jinn and young Obi-Wan Kenobi in Episode I: The Phantom Menace, then The Elder is perfect for you.</p><p>Set before Episode I, The Elder depicts a Jedi and his Padawan investigating a disturbance in the Force at a rural Outer Rim planet. What awaits them is unlike anything the pair have encountered, and proves to be a near-death experience for both of them.</p><p>Another episode that gives us a glimpse into the nomadic life of a Jedi, this one gets top marks for its dramatic action and the back-and-forth between the eager Padawan and his cautious master. Things ramp up considerably when the titular Elder makes his appearance.</p><p><strong>2. Lop and Ochō by Geno Studio</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sm.ign.com/ign_ap/screenshot/default/star-wars-visions-special-look-disney-2-26-screenshot-162535_kv4x.jpg><p>The visuals and story of Lop and Ochō is almost like a complete film all by itself, with the entire episode truly immersing you into its stunning interpretation of life within the Empire’s control. It explores familial relationships, which remind us of Mamoru Hasoda’s The Boy and the Beast.</p><p>This episode centers around Lop, an anthropomorphic bunny-like slave of the Empire, who escapes and is adopted by the Yasaburo clan. She gains an adopted father and a sister, Ochō, who is more than elated to embrace Lop into the family.</p><p>We then see a seven-year time skip, where we get to see the strenuous relationship between the clan members and their conflict with Palpatine’s empire. It’s another interpretation of Luke and Leia’s sibling relationship, one that is truly taken to the extreme. We definitely hope this gets to become its own series or movie someday.</p><p><strong>1. The Ninth Jedi by Production I.G</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sm.ign.com/ign_ap/screenshot/default/2021-08-12-trailer-uhd-r709f-still-020885930_sxs9.jpg><p>Honestly, it was truly hard to pick between The Ninth Jedi and Lop and Ochō for the number one spot, but somehow, The Ninth Jedi scratches by with its unique premise and complete display of both spectrums of the Force.</p><p>This is definitely another episode that feels like a great pilot episode to something much greater, and really makes great use of Star Wars’ lore and history. What is more interesting is how this episode is the only one that takes place after Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker, making it the only piece of media that tackles that side of Star Wars.</p><p>Featuring a story of the daughter of a legendary sabersmith and a meeting between some of the galaxy’s last remaining Jedis, the entire pacing and story of this short makes you forget that it is a short film. The best of the best, and definitely the main highlight of this anthology series.</p><h4>Overall Verdict</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sm.ign.com/ign_ap/screenshot/default/242593385-3120803958157103-1699260622425591024-n_ch7h.jpg><p>All in all, Star Wars: Visions is one of the best things to come out of the franchise since The Mandalorian. What it does right is how it interprets tropes and conventions of the franchise in a whole new light, instead of just rehashing them for nostalgia’s sake.</p><p>Which is the main problem with Episode VII, VIII, and IX, which were more concerned with showcasing what everyone loved about Star Wars, instead of showing us anything new.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/12/11/swv-visionslogo-en-small-1607687888823.jpg><p>While it is a bit silly that every other episode of Star Wars: Visions takes place in some version of feudal Japan in outer space, it nonetheless excels in showing us new ways to use the Force, new lightsaber techniques, and a whole spectrum of diverse characters.</p><p>While the Japanese dub of Star Wars: Visions is great and definitely complements the anime artstyle employed in each episode, we urge you to not skimp out on the English dub. Whether it is Neil Patrick Harris and Allison Brie portraying The Twins, or Simu Liu and Henry Golding having their time as Jedis, it is a worthy English dub for sure.</p><p>Star Wars: Visions is streaming now on Disney+ Hotstar.
