Not because Shalom Harlow is having a runway renaissance (though <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/a41150080/fendi-collina-strada-proenza-schouler-ss23-review/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she is" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">she is</a>, by the way!) but because Bella Hadid closed the Coperni Spring 2023 show in a dress that was spray-painted onto her body using Fabrican, a material from a can that solidifies into wearable fabric. The show was dedicated to "women of this world" and in the show notes designers Sébastien Meyer and Arnaud Vaillan wrote, "To you, women who transcend your body and never lower your gaze before the barbed wire of morality."</p><img alt="editorial use only for non editorial use please seek approval from fashion house performance of fashion model bella hadid during the coperni womenswear springsummer 2023 show as part of paris fashion week on september 30, 2022 in paris, france photo by estropgetty images" title="Coperni : Runway - Paris Fashion Week - Womenswear Spring/Summer 2023" width=3046 height=4569 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1664573079.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Estrop</span><p>Bella Hadid entering the Coperni Spring 2023 runway in nothing but underwear.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She entered the runway in a pair of white underwear, her chest covered with one arm, and left with a tight off-the shoulder asymmetrical white dress, complete with leg slit. Audience members' mouths were surely agape, but in typical 2022 fashion, it was hard to see anyone's face behind their phones, and it was more of a spectacle than a commentary on anything. The moment was circulating all over Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter within seconds.</p><img alt="paris, france september 30 editorial use only for non editorial use please seek approval from fashion house bella hadid walks the runway during the coperni womenswear springsummer 2023 show as part of paris fashion week on september 30, 2022 in paris, france photo by pierre suugetty images" title="Coperni : Runway - Paris Fashion Week - Womenswear Spring/Summer 2023" width=6706 height=4473 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1664573151.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Pierre Suu</span><p>The finale dress being sprayed onto Bella Hadid at the Coperni 2023 Spring show.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hadid is the archival fashion poster child for Gen Z, and it feels right that she would be the model for this moment. All those fashion lovers who learned about vintage from Hadid's street style (recently, she can't stop wearing a Richard Prince x Louis Vuitton bag from Marc Jacob's 2008 collection) likely posted a photo of the Shalom Harlow moment on their Tumblrs in High School—and now they have a whole new moment to obsess over.<br></p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
