They declined to be named as they were not directly involved in the patient's treatment.</p><p>The low quality of the image, which was published in British newspapers today, led to speculation it was faked - especially since it first appeared in a brash Moscow tabloid newspaper and on a website widely believed by locals to run stories of doubtful authenticity.</p><p>The senior surgeon at the hospital would not confirm Julia's name to protect her privacy.<br></p><p>But he said: 'The case was last autumn. She spent about 40 minutes walking home after she was attacked.'</p><p>Despite the length of the blade, he said, it missed her spinal cord and major arteries in her neck.<br></p><p>'The knife was stuck in her bone,' he said. 'It's an absolutely unique and extraordinary case. She was so lucky. The only thing damaged was the bone.'</p><p>Julia only realised something was wrong when she arrived home and her parents saw what had happened. An ambulance was at the house within 15 minutes - meaning the woman spent over an hour with the blade in her back before she was seen by doctors.</p><p>It was on her arrival at the hospital that the image was taken.<br></p><p>The surgeon confirmed the picture had been taken by medics - but he could not say how it fell into the hands of the Russian newspaper Tvoi Den.</p><p>The doctors, he said, operated immediately to remove the knife.<br></p><p>It is believed that Julia spent ten days in the hospital after the operation. 'She had a straightforward recovery,' the surgeon said - suffering no long-term effects from the horrific attack.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Bc4CXamxuZ4Sdsm651KCeoqaXYsOqr9OipGahnpi1brfNop2eZV2ZtqW602alqKyZmLJvtNOmow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
