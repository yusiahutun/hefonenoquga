They raised five boys and four girls on their family homestead and were well respected in the community. However, during Prohibition, the family expanded its business enterprises to make and sell moonshine to make ends meet.

The <span class=searchHighlight>gang</span> engaged in one of its first crimes in 1915 with a bank heist in Stuart and ended up robbing the Bank of Stuart twice. Although there are only three known bank robberies orchestrated by the <span class=searchHighlight>gang</span>, every unsolved crime in South Florida was attributed to them.</p><p>John&nbsp;and three of the&nbsp;members’ lives came to an end on November 1, 1924, when the <span class=searchHighlight>gang</span> was captured and shot by Indian River County deputies on the Sebastian River Bridge.</p><p><span>“The Ashley Gang’s intriguing saga is filled with so many complex details that it is still being researched and discussed today as a significant piece of Martin County’s rich history,” said Rob Steele, president and CEO of the Historical Society of Martin County, which operates the Elliott Museum. “2024 will be the 100th anniversary of their deaths, yet the legendary exploits of the Ashley Gang still captivate history lovers, and all who love an exciting story.”</span></p><p>The Elliott Museum is open seven days a week from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. For more information, visit the <a href=# rel=noopener>website</a> or call the Elliott Museum at 772-225-1961.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tMDUmqmtpZGcrru1zZ5lnKedZMGptc2gqmasn2KxsHvAq6auppRiwbDDzWaroaGenMBuwM5mm6hnkai1rbHYZp6appdisrm0yJugrWWclrulv4yaq2adnKG2sMDTZqSuq5WqunA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
