 On Thursday afternoon, the day before the Royal Wedding, I was sitting in my dentist’s chair, about to have a filling repaired (a white one, obviously; I haven’t had any silver fillings since the late Eighties). As the injection numbed my tongue (I said ‘injection’ not ‘injunction’), we chatted about the upcoming nuptials."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We are all privy to the knowledge of who has done what to whom.’</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/05/01/article-0-0BD44F0F00000578-236_468x570.jpg height=570 width=468 alt="Dazzling: The Duchess of Cambridge has big, even teeth and a broad smile, leading to speculation she may have had some work done" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Dazzling: The Duchess of Cambridge has big, even teeth and a broad smile, leading to speculation she may have had some work done</p><p>He told me Kate’s smile is very different now to the one she had two years ago.

But the reality is, of course, a little more complicated than that.<br></p><p>I used to have horrible teeth. As a child, my mouth was overcrowded and every tooth was crooked. I wore braces for two years: on the bottom teeth, metal wires were cemented on. On the top teeth, I wore spider-like wires attached to a plastic plate, and every night I had to loop tiny rubber bands around all the tiny hooks, to move the teeth farther.&nbsp;</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=2>2</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=3>3</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/05/01/article-1382390-0BDB188300000578-512_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Kate is every inch the people's princess as she steps out in High Street frock for first day as a Royal</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/05/02/article-1382603-0BDE633400000578-393_87x84.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Face facts!

When the braces were removed, the teeth looked better, but the front two still overlapped. One front tooth was chipped. The teeth had ridges and were not the bright white I had seen on movie stars and fashion models.<br></p><p>And so by 2001, as soon as I had amassed enough money, I headed to Harley Street, to the dentist who had remodelled Martine McCutcheon’s teeth and also (although this was less of a draw) the mouth of Rolf Harris.<br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/05/02/article-1382576-0B82199C00000578-832_468x539.jpg height=539 width=468 alt="Perfect smile: Cheryl Cole has had some work done but has very natural-looking veneers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Perfect smile: Cheryl Cole has had some work done but has very natural-looking veneers</p><p>This dentist, who has since retired, set about placing veneers on the front six teeth, both top and bottom. First, the teeth were filed down to tiny stumps. As I felt them gingerly with my tongue, I experienced a huge amount of alarm. Who on earth would destroy perfectly healthy teeth, beyond the point of no return?<br></p><p>Some weeks later, having made many, many moulds of my mouth, and having left me with temporary plastic teeth, the dentist finally cemented on the acrylic veneers. My teeth now most certainly resembled Martine McCutcheon’s, for the not inconsiderable fee of £10,000, but I was never overly happy with them.<br></p><p>They looked, frankly, unnatural. They stained easily, too, which meant not only careful cleaning, but regular monthly visits to the hygienist. The worst moment was when, on a date, they turned green from the spinach curry. It was not good.<br></p><h2><span>Say cheese</span></h2><h2>Research shows that cosmetic dentistry is most popular among women in their late 40s and 50s&nbsp;</h2><p>And so, in 2006, I returned to Harley Street, this time to the clinic of Dr Michael Carling who has, rather reassuringly, trained for many years in the U.S., where everyone has fabulous teeth, even the politicians.<br></p><p>He told me that the reason my veneers looked unnatural is they were placed too close together: teeth need tiny gaps between each one. He also only uses porcelain, not a synthetic: this is more expensive, but it stains less and lasts longer.<br></p><p>Most importantly, though, he prepared my mouth for the veneers first. He enlisted me on a long course of hygiene treatments, which made sure my gums were in the best possible condition before new veneers were applied.<br></p><p>I was also taught how to look after them myself: an electric toothbrush, Superfloss — it’s soft and must be used around all the edges of the veneer — and regular visits to have them cleaned. They should look good for up to ten years.<br></p><p>I asked Michael what the next big advance in cosmetic dentistry is likely to be, and he thinks it will be implants and veneers made from human enamel, grown in the lab. The newest veneers, applied in the U.S., can add ‘volume’ to your mouth, which is proving popular among older people who have lost plumpness in the cheeks and mouth.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/05/02/article-1382576-0BDD7E7800000578-65_224x311.jpg height=311 width=224 alt="Vanessa Redgrave's teeth do not match her ageing face" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/05/02/article-1382576-0CFEE25B000005DC-438_224x311.jpg height=311 width=224 alt="Ronnie Wood's have a natural stain so that they look more real" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Vanessa Redgrave's teeth do not match her ageing face and Ronnie Wood has a built-in stain to look more natural<br></p><p>But I think veneers can become problematic as you get older. On the very old, they look strange and out of place. Remember Vanessa Redgrave in the final scenes of the movie Atonement? I couldn’t pay attention to what she was saying, because I was dazzled by a smile that belonged on a 20-year-old.<br></p><p>While it is preferable, surely, not to have stained teeth, crooked and gap-ridden like a down-at-heel graveyard, reeking of decay, a la David Dimbleby, veneers need to be toned down on those past the age of 60.<br></p><p>Ronnie Wood, after a lifetime of smoking, decided he needed a new set of teeth, and opted for veneers. ‘I said I want the veneers to be white and they said: “Oh, it’s not Ronnie Wood to have bloody Hollywood teeth.” So we got a built-in stain.’</p><p>The plaudits for how beautiful Kate looked on her wedding day should not just go to Sarah Burton and that dress, after all. I don’t blame her one bit for wanting the perfect smile.<br></p><p>Over the next few decades, it will be plastered on every front page, and beamed in high definition around the world. Her smile reminds me of Diana’s: wholesome, the sort of grin you see on a head girl, not a Hollywood smile at all. Although I do wonder how those teeth will look by the time she is 80.<br></p><p>There is something about the current Queen’s rather dull smile that is charming, and terribly, unapologetically British. Not decay riddled, like the Queen Mother’s, but real, and not remotely vain at all.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn2ScWlub2ZkmYqmjIOGh32DYp2mu8%2BlnGaoka56p7vRraynnV2ZrrvGy6KloGWjoratsYxmm6impGKvqsDEZpqhnadie6nAzKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
