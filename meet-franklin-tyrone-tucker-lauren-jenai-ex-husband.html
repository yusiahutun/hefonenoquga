And so they did. Started as a revolutionary training style, what these two gave birthed allowed people to get fit and healthy in a competitive and welcoming environment, in a way it was never thought of before. So, between then and now, Lauren has always managed to stay in the news be it when discussing how she created this successful business and community over the last two decades or other times for her personal affairs. More recently though, she has been making noise mostly linked to her now estranged hubby Franklin Tyrone Tucker.</p><p>Having said that, in the rest of the writing, we shall mostly discuss Franklin, him as Lauren Jenai’s ex-husband, and other aspects of his life.</p><h3><strong>Meet Franklin Tyrone Tucker, CrossFit Co-Founder Lauren Jenai Ex-Husband</strong></h3><p>So, an insider told PageSix in December 2022 that CrossFit cofounder Lauren Jenai and her husband Franklin Tyrone Tucker <span>have been living apart for over a year (since July 2021) and are expected to divorce after Franklin’s case is resolved.</span></p><p>The pair married in June 2020 in an offbeat Day of the Dead-themed ceremony on Lauren’s lawn in Portland, Oregon. However, it did not take long for the marriage to go south. Also, before that, the couple who had known each other as teenagers had reconnected and then got engaged while Franklin was jailed. It is said that Lauren reached out to Franklin upon hearing about his arrest.</p><p>Anyway, the two separated in 2021, i.e., without a divorce. And despite the break, Lauren stood by Franklin’s innocence as he served his sentence.</p><p>The whole world witnessed the fitness guru put up the $2 million bail money demanding Franklin’s release in a dramatic fashion. Lauren had actually put up two of her homes to secure the bond, some three years ago. Luckily, in December 2022 that bond deal not only expired, but the judge also issued a new, much lower bond. The trial is now expected to be held in the spring of 2023.</p><p>In the meantime, Franklin has been under house arrest since being released on the said $2 million. Until that happened, he was awaiting trial for murder at a Florida detention center.</p><h3><strong>Franklin Tyrone Tucker Treehouse Murder</strong></h3><p>A man was stabbed to death on a staircase leading to a tree house on Stock Island on 17 November 2017. One man was found guilty in the case on 2 December 2022. Another man’s trial was still pending in the case. The “another man’ is none other than Franklin Tyrone Tucker.</p><p>In the meantime, detectives and prosecutors have been believing that the whole situation, now dubbed locally as the “tree house murder”, was over a “crack cocaine deal gone wrong.”</p><p>Franklin, while maintaining his innocence, was bonded out of county jail in 2019. He has since been under house arrest since being released on the $2 million put up by Jenai. Also, Franklin is separately suing police and prosecutors in Monroe County, Florida.</p><h3><strong>Franklin Tyrone Tucker Age</strong></h3><p>Franklin Tyrone Tucker was born in 1971. So, he turned 51 years old in 2022.</p><h3><strong>Franklin Tyrone Tucker Job</strong></h3><p>The last time we heard from the two of them together, Franklin and Lauren, Franklin was doing most of the cooking, ordering groceries in bulk to feed his wife and stepchildren, Colleen, Caitlyn, Hunter, and Troy. But, while this was his full-time job during the stay-at-home pandemic times, he started working as the owner and CEO at Inspirational Investments LLC in Clackamas, Oregon on 1 January 2021.</p><p>From what Franklin cites on Facebook, Inspirational Investments is a holding and management company that specializes in trading digital assets.</p><p>On his LinkedIn, Franklin also mentioned receiving an Associate of Arts (AA) in Secondary Education and Teaching at Central Arizona CollegeCentral Arizona College from 2005 through 2008. Between 2007 and 2009, he also studied Secondary Education and Teaching (History) at Arizona State University.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Franklin Tyrone Tucker’s Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Franklin Tyrone Tucker reportedly had a below $850K net worth in December 2022.</p><p>As for Lauren, though her net worth was undisclosed, she is known to have sold her CrossFit shares for around $20 million as part of her divorce from the brand’s co-founder, Greg Glassman, in 2013. Also, so you know, when she was getting married to Franklin she dismissed the idea of drafting a prenuptial agreement. She said she trusted the man and the idea of having such a document felt “a little inappropriate”.</p><h3><strong>Is Franklin Tyrone Tucker On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Franklin Tyrone Tucker was not on Instagram.
